great books and he's got one now called talking to  jurors I love them and I really enjoyed talking to him and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did please welcome Malcolm Gladwell The Joe Rogan Experience trained by day Joe Rogan podcast by night all day  hello Malcolm Hey Joe how you doing I'm doing very well you sound like you good good that's always a good sign but it's through headphones it's very interesting because I've been listening to talking to strangers uh-huh I like that you narrate your books it's very frustrating with someone who's a great speaker does not narrate their books so thanks for doing that no actually I kind of enjoy I used to hate that process  with my first one and then I've grown to enjoy it because of you when you say your book out loud you see it in a different way like oh you know you get a little bit of a different perspective on it well I'm a giant fan of your work man particularly outliers I really loved that book very Illuminating and sort of peels away the the mystery of talent and so tell me what you're doing what is this talking to strangers I'm into about I'm in the  second chapter right now oh I see well that was that was a book about I was struck by how many of the kind of high-profile cases that we got obsessed with were at their root about the same thing which is the individuals were two people didn't know each other well had an exchange and they got each other wrong so you know everything from Amanda Knox to Bernie Madoff to the  to Larry Nasser at Michigan State to Jerry Sandusky at Penn State and then to the signature case which the book is organized around which is the Sandra Bland case member though young woman Texas it gets pulled over by the side of the road yeah they're all at rude fundamentally the same problem which is there's a there's an exchange between and exchanges goes wrong and the question is why that's what I began to get really fascinated by is you  this point in human evolution Evolution we have got this thing about talking to strangers down hmm and we clearly don't and we're being pushed to talk more and more to strangers right in a kind of globalized world and if we're bad at it that doesn't bode well does it well I think there's also an issue today with people not learning the necessary skills and how to talk to people because so much communication is done digitally yeah that's it  it seems to be a giant issue with young kids they're more Awkward initially talking to people than I think I remember yeah yeah yeah I think that's probably you forget how much I mean adolescent adolescents used to be this one one long rehearsal in how to be a normal human being right conversation and now the rehearsal it's like they were also got cut in half and you know instead of getting to the point where we play basketball  basketballs were still just doing Wind Sprints or so you know mmm right no it's actually playing a game and I'm playing the game I'm butchering the metaphor you I know what you're saying nothing the Sandra Bland case how does that one fit in because that one that that girl was pulled over the cop was 10 she was failure to signal right I mean it's a bullshit thing it's a bullshit thing and she started lighting a cigarette he told told her to put the cigarette out and it all escalated from there  that she said she doesn't have to put the cigarette out and then he says he's got a light her up he's screaming at her he pulls her out of the car he rests her and then is there controversy about whether or not she committed suicide in jail there he is I don't get into that okay because it seemed that seemed unlikely that she was killed that you as opposed to getting so yes it seemed likely that she was killed versus she committed suicide  I think that someone would commit suicide being in jail for 3 Days especially one of the things that you highlighted in the book and you actually played in the audio version of it her little sort of affirmations you know and she was she sounds very positive and upbeat and calling everybody kings and queens and it was everything thanking God and being very thankful and being aware of of life and humility and just graciousness and gratitude  it didn't seem I mean obviously you don't know and what kind of dark things can happen to a person when they're incarcerated for three days for a bullshit reason without maybe that's the straw that broke the camel's back but she did have you know she had a complicated emotional history she had previously I tried to commit suicide and she had she was emerging from quite a difficult period in her life and went to Texas to start anew  thief and so there is an interpretation like I said I don't really have strong feelings on this particular part of the story but there's an interpretation that says here's a woman who's emerged from very difficult period in her life goes leaves you she was in Illinois she drives half across the country to start over and on the first day that she arrives in Texas to start over she gets pulled over by a cop and by the way she had thousands of dollars in outstanding  tickets so she had a history of this bullshit stuff with cops where you know the the same trap that many poor people in this country get into which is they get the police use people as an ATM right they like set them off for a non trivial things and when they can't find when the campaign to find they get another fun and when you know you have that ghost she was part of in that trap so here she is trying to start over  difficult time gets first day she gets to Texas she gets pulled over again and she in her mind it's the same she's like oh my God I tried to start over and I can't yeah and then she's in jail and she can't make bail and you know there's a scenario where you can see that she just began to despair don't they take away your shoelaces and do Old Town Texas yeah are they doing things by the book and I mean I find the whole thing about I went to that town when I was reporting  book and you know the it's kind of hard to be to kill to kill someone and get away get away with it requires a level of expertise in four thought that struck me was not present in that little town in Texas I mean a certain time it's just not I don't they're not lat do not think in this is these are not people playing chess right I think they it's just encountered it with this  cop and he's not very good at his job and he gets way over his head and he completely missed reads her and he pulls her off to jail probably deeply regrets the whole incident and they're all embarrassed in sitting around and hoping it'll just all go away and meanwhile she's all alone in a prison cells spiraling deeper and deeper into depression I mean it's I think it's almost more tragic that she commits suicide she committed suicide it's insane that you can keep someone in jail  jail for three days for failure to Signal it seems like there should have been an initial review of the circumstances that led to her getting pulled out of the car in the first place and the cops should have been fired immediately they just look you're screaming at her because she lit a cigarette yeah in their own car we well this is fascinating and I feel like I don't know you and I are probably the same age there's this so the cops 29 if you grew up with cigarettes you have a different understanding of the meaning of lighting a cigarette  that so what's happening in the encounter is he pulls her over what he does is he sees her coming out of this University campus and while she still on campus property she rolls through a stop sign and then he notices that she's got out-of-state plates and she's a young black woman and she's driving a Hyundai like not a not a Mercedes Benz and he thinks ha I'm going to check this out so he she pulls onto the road and he drives up behind  and her aggressively he speeds up behind her so what does she do well what any of us would do she gets out of the way thinking oh he's a he's going to he's going to you know the scene of an accident or something I better get his way she pulls over to get out of his way and he goes oh you didn't use your turning signal and he pulls him up pulls her over and put him behind her and by the way whenever I hear a fire department truck or a police car coming and I pulled over to get out of the way I do not use my turning signal right you just get  the way it's reflexive right so her immediate thought is what he does is like oh this is bullshit and he tricked me and he knows what he's doing that's exactly what he wanted he wanted to get her in situation because it's all a pretext he just wants he think so maybe there's something weird with her so then here we have this all on tape of course because this is in this is one of the reasons I was captured entirely on the dash cam the officers dash cam it goes up to the window and he says  he looks at her and he realizes she's agitated why because I haven't she's pissed off and he was ma'am is there something wrong and she's like well you know I want to know why I'm below over boola and then he goes back to his car and he comes back to her and he later says in a deposition that when he goes back to his to his vehicle to check on her license and registration he begins to develop suspicions that she's up to no good she's got drugs or guns and so she comes back and they commenced to have this  increasingly heated conversation and she lights the cigarette because she's trying to calm herself down and this is my point you and I who grew up in an era where people smoked all the time no that one of the principal functions of lighting a cigarette was to calm your nerves and in her mind I think in her mind she's trying to signal to the cop let's deescalate this and I'm one of the ways I'm going to show you that I want to deescalate this is I'm going to take a moment  and I just cigarette and just take it down a notch and let's have a real conversation he doesn't understand the meaning of that gesture and he thinks oh she thinks several things he thinks one she's messing with me she's defying my authority by lighting a cigarette she's going to blow smoke in my face or something you know nefarious or she's gonna like take the lighted cigarette and put it out of my he has those kind of weird crazy fantasies this is what he said you  position oh yeah he so even on the level I try and identify in the book all of the different ways and this is when I come back to the case at the end of the book I go through this in more detail all the different ways in which he completely misunderstands her and one of them is he doesn't understand the meaning of lighting a cigarette in a moment of tension and that's you know still more evidence why you need if you're a cop or anyone dealing with a stranger you need to slow down and just not jump to any conclusions because  there's so much you can miss  what it seemed to me when I listened to it initially and then I listen to it again and your audio book there's a thing that happens with police officers and I've never been a police officer but I was a security guard for a brief period of time and I recognize it in myself and I recognized in a lot of people that I work with is that you start treating the other people like the other like it's us and them it was us the sky worked at great great Woods it's a performance center in Mansfield Massachusetts like this  and we would catch a lot of people smuggling booze in things like that and there was an attitude that you got and I was only there for one summer but there's an attitude of they were they were the bad people you were the good guys it was us and them and we stuck together and they weren't us and cops get that a hundred times worse because there's guns involved and they can get shot at we've all seen videos of  got cops pulling people over and he says can I see your hands please and guy pulls out a gun and shoots out them we've all seen those videos those are this is always in the back of the mind of cops yeah and I think that was just a guy who as you said 29 years old is a young guy he's not that bright not good at communication and he is this attitude that he's a cop and that you have to listen to the cops because he's them and you're you yeah and that that's like when he  telling her to put the cigarette out and she's saying I don't have to do that and he's saying get out of your vehicle and she's saying I don't have to do that and then he's screaming at her I mean that's that's all right there I mean it seems like to me he wants compliance he wants her to listen he does yeah he does what he gets it's funny the what's remarkable about that tape which I must have seen 50 times and which has been viewed on YouTube you know even a couple million times is how quickly it escalates yeah  no the whole thing is it's insanely short yeah you you would think if I was telling you the story of this you would think oh this unfolds over 10 minutes and it doesn't it unfolds over a minute and a half and that what I remember years ago I wrote my second book blink and I have in that book a chapter about a very famous Infamous police shooting in New York case of Amadou Diallo I remember that remember that when we shot like 40 times by cops  and one of the big things I was interested in talking about that case was how long does it take how long did it take for that hole  terrible sequence to go down so from the moment the police developed suspicions about Amadou Diallo to the moment that Amadou Diallo is lying dead on his front porch how long how much time elapsed and the answer is like two seconds it's bumbu is like and I had a conversation with actually here in the valley with Gavin de Becker has he ever been on your show no fascinating guy we were  three experts security expert incredibly interesting guys friends with Sam Harris I know that yes yeah and he was talking about this question of time that when you're a security guard guarding someone you know famous a lot of what you're trying to do is to inject time into the scenario instead of you don't want something to unfold in a second and a half where you have almost no time to react properly and what you want to do is to undo it to unfold in 5 seconds if you can add a  I'm making this up I can't remember his exact term but basically what your job is is to add seconds into the the encounter so that you have a chance to intelligently respond to what's going on and so he was hit this great riff about how good Israeli secret secure Secret Service guys are and one of the things they do is they're they're either not armed or they don't they're trained not to go for their weapons and  situations because it's point is so say you're guarding the president your body man but the president you walking through a crowd somebody comes up to you like pulls a gun wants to shoot the president it's point is if you're the secret security guy and your first instinct in response to someone pulling a gun is to go for your own gun you've lost a second and a half right your hands got to go down to your your whole focus is on getting to your own gun and in the meantime the other guy whose guns already out  has already shot you've lost you need to be someone who forgets about your own gun and just focuses on the on the man in front of you right and protecting the president but it was all in the context of time is is really crucial variable in these kinds of encounters and everything as a police officer you should be doing is slowing it down wait you know analyze what's happening and that's what he doesn't do the  in this instance speeds it up right he goes to Defcon you know she lights a cigarette and within seconds he screaming at her this is a you know a parent shouldn't do that I mean let a little police officer by the side of the highway right but the difference is he knows she's not a criminal  I mean he must know it's bullshit he's pulling her over because he's trying to write a ticket and the way he's communicating with her when she lights a cigarette it's like she's inferior like he this is not someone who's scared he's not scared of a perpetrators not scared that there's a criminal in the car about to shoot him he's not scared of that at all he wants utter total complete compliance and he's talking to her like like he's a Drill Sergeant the Kent  can't both those things be true  how so well in that so in the deposition he gives which I get to the end of the book and I got the tape of the deposition it's bad it's totally fascinating it's like he's sitting down with the investigating officer in the looking into the death of Sandra Bland and he's got I don't know how long it is two hours and he's walking them through what he was thinking that day and he makes the case that he was terrified that he was convinced he says he goes back to his squad car a boat  thumbs up and to submit through some evidence to support this so he pulls her over and he goes to the passenger side window and leans in and says ma'am you realize why I pulled you over blah blah and is he okay because he/she doesn't seem right to him she gives him her license he goes back to his squad car and he says while he's in the squad car he looks ahead and he sees her making what he calls furtive movements so he's like furtive movements also he thinks she's being all kind of Jumpy and you don't know  isn't he just says I saw her moving around in ways I didn't make me happy and then when he returns to the car he returns driver side which is crucial because if you're a cop you go driver side only if you think that you might be in danger right he doesn't if you go driver side you're exposing yourself to the road the only reason you do that is it when your driver side you can see the it's very very difficult if someone has a gun to shoot the police officer who's pulled them over if the police officer is on the driver side right you have an angle  on the passenger side so why does he go if he thinks she's harmless is no reason to go back driver side I think this guy I think these two things are linked I actually believe him he constructs this ridiculous fantasy about how she's dangerous but I think that's just what he was trained to do he's a paranoid cop and then why is he so insistent that she be compliant for the same reason because he's terrified is like do exactly what I say because I don't know what the what's going to happen here  right and she's you know I don't know I I don't think those two those two strains of of interpretation are mutually exclusive hmm that's interesting it didn't sound like he was scared at all it sounds like he was pissed that she wasn't listening to him yeah I didn't I didn't think he sounded even remotely scared I felt like he had I mean we're reading into it at right right I have no idea but from my interpretation was  he had decided that she wasn't listening to him and he was going to make her listen to him yeah that's what I got out of it I didn't get any fear and I thought that version of it that he described just sounds like horse shit it sounds like what you would say after the fact to strengthen your case well the so there's another element in here that I get into which is I got his record as a police officer it's a bit on the on the force for I forgot 9 10 months and we have a record of every traffic stop here  mermaid and when you look at his list of traffic stops Uris you realize that what happened that day with Sandra Bland was not an anomaly that he's one of those guys who pulls over everyone for bullshit reasons all day long so I think I've forgotten exact number but in the hour before he pulled over Sandra Bland he pulled over for people for other people for equally ridiculous reasons he's that cop and he's that cop because he's been trained that way right  kind of quotas strain strain of modern policing which says go beyond the ticket pull someone over if you if anything looks a little bit weird because you might find something else now if you look at his history as a cop he almost never found anything else his history is a copy in fact I went through those I forget how many hundreds of traffic stops he had in nine months if you go through them he has like once he found some marijuana on a kid and by the way the town in which he was working as a college town so I mean how hard is that  I think he found a gun once misdemeanor gun but everything else was like pulling over people for you know the the light above their license plate was out that that's the level of stuff he was using he did this all day long every day so he's like to him it's second nature yeah pull her over like who knows what's going on she's out of state she's young black woman was this comparable to the way the rest of the cops  force in his division did it well I looked at I didn't look at the rest of the cops on his voice what I looked at were State numbers to the wherever there are several American states give us like North Carolina for example will give us precise complete statistics on the number of traffic stops done by their police officers and the reasons for those stops so when you look at that so I have the I look at the North Carolina  numbers for example in the North Carolina Highway Patrol it's the same thing they're pulling over unbelievable numbers of people and finding nothing like night you know 1% less than 1% hit rates in some cases of being hit right being finding something of Interest so like the pulling over 99 people for no reason or to find one person who's got you know a bag of dope or something in the car you cannot conduct policing in in a civil society  Eddie like that and expect to have decent relationships between law enforcement and the civilian population yeah no question but doesn't that sort of support the idea that he's full of shit that he was really concerned that she had something he had never encountered anything well or or this was the one the fantasy and he's had his so what so the question is why does he keep doing it if this is got who day in day out pulls over people for no reason and finds nothing and continues to do it now there's two explanations one is he's totally cynical and thinks  this is the way to Be an Effective police officer exclamation number two is this is a guy who has a powerful fantasy in his head that one day I'm gonna hit the jackpot I'm gonna open the trunk and is going to be 15 pounds of heroin and I'm going to be the biggest star who ever lived I think there's also a rush of just being able to get people to pull over this the compliance thing which is another reason why he was so Furious that she wasn't listening to him yeah and she kept a cigarette lit yeah or she was listening but not complying yes yeah  what are the laws I mean are you allowed to smoke a cigarette in your car when a cop pulls you over how does it work like that yeah I mean of course yeah we can't stop you from a gauging they can't tell you to put out your cigarette there's no law that go he could have said mean no there's no law I mean by the Colorado two things the courts historically give enormously way to the police officers in a traffic stop as opposed to a person to person stopped but but  no I I mean this is about what he should have said is he could have said ma'am do you mind I would prefer if you put out the cigarette while we're talking or I'm allergic to smoke or whatever I mean he's a million ways to do it nicely he said yeah but he's he's a jackass about but he's I mean he's basically doing the job like a jackass he's doing a jackass version of being a cop well so this is so this is one of a really really crucial  in the argument of the book which is  I think the real lesson of that case is not that he's a bad cop he is in fact doing precisely as he is was in trained and instructed to do he's a he's the ideal cop and the problem is with the particular Philosophy of Law Enforcement that has emerged over the last 10 years in this country which has incentivized and encouraged police officers to engage in these incredibly low reward activities like pulling over  a hundred people are to find one person is because something wrong that is become enshrined in the strategy of many police forces around the country they tell them to do this I have a whole section of book right go through in detail of one of the most important police training manuals which is you know required reading for somebody coming up and which they just walk you through this like it is your job to pull over lots and lots and lots and lots of people even if you only find something in a small percentage of cases  why that's what being a proactive police officers all about right so they are trained at that phrase go beyond the ticket is a is a term of Art in police training like you got to be thinking you sure you pull them over for having a tail light that's out but your look you're thinking beyond that is there something else in the car that's problematic that's to try to find so there he was being a dutiful police officer in the the answer is to re-examine our  philosophies of law enforcement not to not I mean you can't dismiss this thing by saying oh that's just a particularly bad cop right that great but I don't know if he's any worse than you know he's just doing what he was trained to do that's the issue should be treated with him and efferent right that is the issue right the issue is there this is standard practice to treat citizens that are doing nothing wrong as if they're criminals yeah and pull them over and give them extreme paranoia and freak them out yeah I I find  I was home I'm Canadian and I was home in Canada small town Canada couple weeks ago and I saw in the back you know how these guys always have their often had a slogan on the side of the car the back of the car so in my little Hometown and Southwestern Ontario sleepy you know Farm country the the slogan on the back of the police cars is people helping people so Canadian right it is so clean it's awesome like the external understand this is a country  tree with very very low levels of gun ownership which means that a police officer does not enter into an encounter with a civilian with the same degree of fear or paranoia that the civilian has a handgun right which is a big part of this regardless of how one feels about gun laws in this country the fact that there are lots of guns mean makes the job of a police officer a lot harder and every police officer will tell you that in Canada the you don't have that fear but it's also Canada and its small town Canada and so when you encounter a police officer in  will Town his like he's people helping people he's like he's like driving like a Camry and he's you know he's like this genial person who's really camera means I forgotten exactly what they're dry they're not like they're not driving ex-coworkers yeah explorers painted black with like big bull bars at the front right and then you go you know I was you go I mean even in La you know I like the cars are painted black and white they them so they look for  ferocious I mean the whole thing is that what it is to look ferocious do I just look they identify as police to connait to a Canadian looks to me it looks a little why do they have to paint them black for that's nothing Oakland Raiders I mean it's like what do you think they should pay them something mild and like bright yellow something lovely something wobbly like a nice can you imagine like a teal or lime green well that would be yeah because there's a lot of black cars a lot of white cars on a lot of teal cars it's go  so it would stand out like oh it's cop is pink car but you know this kind of symbolism right matters right right you all expecting an image Sheriff Joe Arpaio who makes all of his prisoners wear pink yeah yeah that's kind of thing well I mean to against his point though how many women shoot cops isn't that an insanely low number yeah I mean insanely low I mean what are the numbers mean it's probably almost  an existent guys pull over women I don't think they're worried about being shot I really don't I think it's horseshit I think it's all after the fact yeah he was trying to concoct some sort of an excuse I'm going to excuse for is he still on the force I know here has either he's kicked off for I forgotten the precise language they use but for basically being impolite to a civilian but yeah I don't think there's a lot of I don't know  I mean I still think we're saying the same thing which is the thing that's driving him his motivation is not rational right and if you were a rational actor you would never engage in an activity where 99.9% of your police stops resulted in nothing burn your he's he is often some weird kind of fantasy land for a reason which is that's what in certain jurisdictions in this country that's what law enforcement has come to look at look like  that's that's problematic it's a huge problem yeah the Power Trip aspect of it I mean you know I've often said what would they do you know because there are certain out there certain areas where police officers do have quotas or they have to write a certain amount of tickets what will they do if no one broke the law for six months welcome to the show that's what small town Canada yeah it's right it's not what would they do I mean I really be curious like what would happen to the numbers like because you boy  you're saying that these people is an ATM there really do mean people are their glorified Revenue collectors they're pulling people over trying to write huge tickets and I believe is North Carolina where you're talking about that's got this creepy law that they've recently I think they've recently changed it where you're allowed to just confiscate people's money because if you see like I pull you over hey Malcolm why do you have three thousand dollars on you yeah you have $3,000 in cash what are you doing with $3,000 Kimmy  that money and they take it and you have to prove that you weren't going to buy heroin or by illegal guns or whatever and then most of that money wound up going to the police department yeah so they used it to like build a fucking gym for the cops or whatever I mean he's literally they had an incentive to keep the money and is that North Carolina that they did that there's a number of states that have Carolina that have this confiscation civil four people lost yeah and they're really gross do they still have that orders  I mean I know it's check extremely controversial and people are up in arms and Furious that you know their money has been stolen people on the way to buy a car for instance you know and they get pulled over in the Kabul just take all the money this is what I talked a little bit about the Ferguson case in my book later on tonight this is what Ferguson was ultimately about the focus in the Ferguson case was whether the officer in that case is Darren Wilson what he did and didn't do to Michael Brown but the real  story when the barber just has investigated the real story is not being kind of chinos to it is that that that the police department in Ferguson was being run as a revenue-generating arm of the city government and people in city government were directing the activities of law enforcement to maximize revenue and at this is incredible stories of there's one story where there's a guy who's just been playing basketball and he's sitting in his car  parked by the basketball court like cooling off after play basketball cop roles in pulls up behind him and ends up writing eight tickets including accuses the guy being a pedophile gets him for one of these you get some is putting a false name on his driver's license when his driver's license his real name was like Michael and his driver's license had Mike like that's the level of eight tickets right that was routine practices  and so you you know you there's a reason why a kid like Michael Brown in Ferguson is gets really angry at law enforcement because law enforcement was a completely discredited institution in that City for years and years and years and years and years they had been basically praying they had been praying on the on the low-income community of that town so of course relationships between the population and the cops had reached a low ebb that's a real  you know there's a it's funny the one of the reasons I wanted to write this book was then the kind of conversations we have around these things Frozen is a great example 95% of the conversation about Ferguson was just about trying to break down what happened between a cop and Michael Brown and the issue when we finally look at it in a systematic manner we realize oh no it's not about that it is about a system that had been in place for years and years and years and years when which the the the African-American population that  town had been preyed upon by the police department that is the broader and you cannot come to an understanding of what happened with Michael Brown until you willing to engage that case on that much more broader systemic level  when you make the title of this book talking to strangers are you do you have a goal that you're trying to achieve are you trying to illuminate certain aspect of communication you trying to highlight issues that people have had with these stories like the Michael Brown story or yeah I mean I'm trying to  I wanted to start with the premise of why are we so bad at you know like I tell the story in the book of the Larry Nasser Case of Michigan State which ones are that's the guy remember the doctor for the gymnastics team oh yeah turns out to have been sexually molested file yeah you Jennifer so there you have a case where everyone thinks they know this guy he's their friend he's this gifted doctor the parents are willingly bringing their kids to to be treated by him the parents are in  room while he is abusing their kids and they don't see it the kids are saying something weird happened in the parents are dismissing it so I wanted to that's a good example of a phenomenon that I wanted to try and explain which is how is that possible how can we think we know someone and be so completely wrong how can you take your kid to a doctor and think the doctor is the greatest possible doctor and he in fact what he's doing is abusing you  your child in front of you right and that's a very similar kind of problem to Bernie Madoff people invested their life savings with this guy not not little old ladies in Dubuque sophisticated Savvy incredibly intelligent investors handed over millions of dollars to this guy who was not even true I mean the Madoff fraud was so outrageous he didn't even bother to him  he didn't even put it in t-bills I mean he just spent it it was just like crazy what's T bills treasury bills oh I mean he wasn't even he was he was 100% sociopath fraud yes and people over the course of 20 years wrote check after check after check after check to him thinking was This brilliant investor you know it's like that's a puzzle that's what I want to get it like people did recognize as something was wrong  wrong right you're the were financial analyst that were saying that this doesn't make sense a few of them but it's funny there's a my favorite story on the in the Madoff chapter is the greatest hedge fund in the world is Renaissance Technologies these are the guys out in Long Island who have had like 30 percent returns for 25 years they're like all PhD are you know AI genius literally Geniuses and they found themselves  his before bit off was busted they found themselves with I think 30 million dollars in a Madoff fund because of some complicated transaction and they're all Geniuses so they look at what made us doing it again and I don't look good like that doesn't make any sense to me and so like what should we do we have 30 million dollar stake in a fund and we don't understand what the guys doing and you would think logically they would sell their stake they don't because it's returning know it did in fact it's not even returning that their own legit returns are twice  is his illegitimate returns they're making they actually make the point that his returns it really low for us like there's no reason for us to keep their money but they don't sell what and so that's what I was trying to stand like they can't even you know there's this notion I'm talking about is called default to truth which is this idea from a researcher called Tim Lovin which is as human beings we are trusting engines we are evolved to give people the benefit of the doubt and once you understand that and why do we do that because it's the right move 99%  percent of the time most people are being truthful and if you have is your strategy I'm going to believe what people say it makes you fantastic friend a wonderful person to work with it means that you can you know skate through the world with a minimum of fuss if you're the parent like person is a person whose life is a nightmare right because they are suspicious of everything that moves so we evolved  to be trusting engines because that makes your life easier but the best part of human people want to mate with you like if you want to talk an evolution in terms about who passes on their genes nice people pass on their genes it given the choice between having a child with a crazy suspicious paranoid person or a loving trusting person you choose a loving trusting person a hundred percent of the time so multiply that out times a million years of human history you realize trusting genes beat  no jeans every day of the week right so that's what we are what credulous by by by evolutionary choice so those guys at in the Renaissance there are no different they may be smarter than the rest of us but they're not constructed differently their inclination is to believe people and like well I don't know guy says he's a good investor me why not let's hang on to it see what happens right that's their motive they don't they don't you don't get to run a organization as  cessful as Renaissance Technologies if you're some crazy paranoid person right how would you even invest in anything if you were crazy and paranoid there was a lot of people that were really intelligent than invested in Bernie madoffs hedge fund to Steven Spielberg was one of them you lost it shit ton of money oh yeah I mean look at the roster list there isn't a you cannot point to an unsophisticated investor on the list of people who lost the most money from the every one of them was smart that's strange it's so great it's great like think about like and by the way  getting a decent return in the market is super easy you you go to Beto Vanguard and they you know they'll give you the market return your in your ass on that hard but these people like they wanted to do something fancier and they and that's what happened well he when you realized what a sociopath he actually was is in the interviews after he's caught or he's demanding certain things and complaining about certain things he doesn't seem to have any remorse no no he wants better  treatment he wants better food he doesn't seem to have any remorse that he's you know literally robbed people their retirement yeah ruined the last part of their lives where they thought they were going to have a considerable sum of money to sit back and just enjoy their grandchildren know now they're broke now they're poor yeah and now they have to figure out a way to get by and eat he doesn't give a shit he did he doesn't in fact what's weird there's so many things weird about the Madoff case one of them is we forget  it he doesn't get caught he turns himself in right and he turns himself in because not because he's screwing up because he's quote unquote so good because remember the financial crisis hit in 2008 and his clients are losing so much money on their legit Investments that they go to man up and say can I have some of my money back from you I got to pay off all the stuff I've done that it's gone sour so like in effect no one ever caught him he get  get caught by a once-in-a you know one-in-a-million circumstance where he's the only one making any money for his clients so they come after him my point is if you if you're totally rational and you look at this you say here's a guy who managed to bamboozle the most sophisticated people in the world to the tune of billions of dollars for 25 years he only gets caught because we had a once in a lifetime Financial meltdown isn't the rational lesson of that that we should all be Bernie madoffs  Ray is like super easy it's like not that hard I could all I have to do is you know he dressed really nicely I get really nice office space on the east side of Manhattan whatwhat did he actually do nothing really didn't invest in anything you just moved to other people's money around and he ran a Ponzi scheme he spent a lot of it and how does son's not catch on to this it's good question because they're not being but one of them committed suicide right that's right and  so it's an open question of how much they do how much anyone else knew I you know the older I get the more I believe in the powers of particularly within within family denial is something now I don't find hard to believe hmm so your ability I've now heard so many stories of you know a parent is some kind of monster and family members just won't see it  it just can't bring themselves to go that so did they know something everyone knew there was something slightly fishy and what Bernie was doing but they never went so far as to think that he was just making it up so they knew something was up but they didn't know it was a hundred percent horseshit they thought that he was so there were some people thought that he actually had Investments but he was there was a suspicion for example he was front-running that because he had a larger business  sort of managing the deal flow in the NASDAQ that he would get Advanced word of where money was flowing and he would jump ahead of the queue by stocks before other people did and profit off the when the stock would rise he would just sell in profit of that difference so there was a feeling that he had a dubious kind of illegitimate strategy that nonetheless legitimately made him a lot of money so people like well if so long as he can get away with it and I can profit off it I'm fine  but the truth is he wasn't doing that at all into this he was just he was he had his he had some Confederate in the Attic of his company essentially making up trade orders from scratch I mean they were just making shit up did how many people got arrested I forget I think they took I can't remember the exact number I think they got he had two Confederates I think he went down with him that's it I think it's what it was he in retrospect it's a really it's one of these crazy it's one of these  you think you know that whole institutions would have fallen yes no this did you ever hear the conversation that he had I believe it was recorded somehow on a phone or something or maybe it was after he was in jail where he's talking about trying to get money back from one of his biggest investors the guy had gotten like a billion dollars from him over the years that's right yeah right yeah he's like you got to give the money back he's like fuck you I'm not giving you shit yeah and you know then this  this crazy conversation where he's basically telling this guy look you knew this was bullshit and you are making money off this and now you know yeah yeah so so this is like the clever so you think about this that guy I know she's actually talking about yeah so it's a game thus to let's just do a let's do a a a hypothetical scenario okay you have a friend who's an incredible salesman and is gone around Europe and Saudi Arabia and raised  in our fund 20 billion dollar fund and they're promising a 20% return a year on your investment right so you give them a million you're getting two hundred thousand dollars a year back from this thing you know it's all bullshit but no one else does what is the rational thing for you to do the rational thing for you to do is to take your onion million dollar investment is to take the two hundred thousand dollars that is made made in quotation marks every year out of the fund so you say most people you know when you invest in  in stocks and only what you do is you check the box I want my I want any dividends or earnings reinvested in the fund don't check the box take the real cash so if you're investing with this phony friend of yours for 20 years you're going to get two hundred thousand dollars a year for 20 years that's four million dollars you will make four million clear of your out of your 1 million initial investment in in 20 years right that's  art if you know what's going on so that's what some people did with Madoff they're like yeah I don't know what he's doing these returns are pretty fantastic I'm just going to take all my earnings off the table every single year so they are the ones who the real winners of this whole thing with those people because this money is not real that money's coming from other investors is the things being made actually what happens with them like if a guy does make all these millions of dollars like that one guy he had to so give some of it back  yes it when happens is they appoint remember they appoint a after the Scandal breaks and been made up is invested they bring in a kind of supervisor potential supervisor who has the power to clawback winnings from money from the people who took who took cash off the table so but not everyone had to claw back in the question was how far back do we go so if you were investing if you were invested with Madoff 25 years ago and you took  you know 10 million off the table between 1990 and 1993 do you have to give that up too like it gets complicated also how can you prove that he was doing the same activity back that actually exactly oh it's a conversation I really wish I could remember where I was hearing this conversation but somebody had recorded Madoff talking to this guy tell them look you gotta give that money back yeah yeah yeah my schwab fun looks better and better all the time it's just so scary to me  that mean finances in the stock market and all that stuff is always looked like magic like what is going on there what are they doing they're moving these numbers around like when you see the ticker tape Roll by like what what is all that if you don't have any understanding of it it's like a foreign language yeah and so you're hoping that all these Geniuses can't be duped all these people throwing their tickets up in the air and everybody this is really goodbye cell they all know what's going on you don't know what's going on but hey there's a lot of things that you know that they don't know and this is just how the world works yeah turns out no turns out the people  people that were involved in this crazy very difficult to understand thing didn't know it either like they barely can understand it and this guy was just stealing money in some weird way and if the stock market didn't crash if we didn't have some sort of a depression who knows how he might still be in operation today he would soak without without the crash of 2008 there's a very very strong possibility that pretty Madoff would still be going gangbusters all he has to do  keep surviving is to take in enough money to cover withdrawals yes so there's some like we said there's a some portion of people who withdrawing their winnings he just needs to make enough to get new enough new money to cover their withdrawal so he's got a fifty billion dollar hedge fund and let's imagine there's a billion and withdrawals coming out every year he's got a raise a billion now if you're burning you already have 50 something hard to raise another  and particularly because he had people all around the world and he was giving them the huge fees to raise money for him so that's the other way that the root of the people who really made money from him were the people who had I forgotten what it was but you would be say you're you're you're Joe the financial guy in Zurich you have a whole bunch of wealthy European clients Bernie would let for every for every million you raised for Bernie Bernie would let you keep I forgot what it was a hundred  and I mean it's a nice base that's real money yeah she just kick back 902 Bernie and keep a hundred grand and that your favorite free and clear no one's climb that back right that's those guys got very very very well very very wealthy that's weird money is sitting in your house that stealing built God that's got to be strange so what can be learned in terms of communication from The Bernie Madoff story well the boot  he made up story and the  all in all of these ways but this one in particular goes to this question of we really think we're good at spotting liars and we're not so virtually every profession that is invested in you know in an investigation of human beings has some belief that you know we know how to figure out is like yes and the truth is nobody does and if someone tells you they are good at spotting Liars there's a 99% chance that they're lying so that the evidence  the see if you could think if we did an experiment here where I had a hundred people parade through this office right now the studio right now and every one of them made a statement in front of you and some wood long as someone tell the truth and I asked you Joe tell me who's lying who's not yours accuracy rate your success rate would be 52 to 54 percent other words slightly better than chance you might as well flip a coin it's not me but if you don't and that's  about you anyone in that chair watching these people parade in front of us is going to do a slightly bit better than chance and the reason was that he better than chance is there are small fraction of people who are such epically bad Liars that there's just we're not going to lose those people like week those are obvious one thing that you can tell those if it's an area of your own personal expertise right like if someone tried to talk to you about what it takes to write a book and get a book published and get a book on the New York Times bestseller list  and they were just making things up you would you would okay so that so this is oh so now you're talking about separate thinking specialist That's content-based So if I pretend to be a UFC fighter you're going to spot my liar my lies in 5 minutes because you know more about the content than I do but let's remove but there you're not catching me because I look like I'm lying you're catching me because I'm saying something that's bullshit I have a good story about that I really have a good start I used to think that I was really good at spotting Liars  and then I met this guy I met him through a friend and that's I'd given myself a pass and then I met him through this friend he was a friend of a friend so I just assumed he was okay because my friend is very good friend and this guy was claiming to be this Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt and he was writing for this online magazine that was like a well-read magazine in the martial arts world and it was the Abu Dhabi combat club they're responsible for this big the Abu Dhabi  submission World Championships is the biggest championships in the world is very highly regarded High Prestige this guy was talking about these fights that he had had and you know people bullshit a little bit so you give people a little bit of room for that but then he was talking about this particular particular move that he had pulled off in a fight that he had just learned from my friend and it's a very difficult move to called The Twister it's basically a guillotine from wrestling  and set up from position called side control it's really complicated you have to wrap someone's leg around you have to roll onto your left shoulder you have to get behind them they have to grab their arm put it over your shoulder grab ahold of their spine and it's essentially like a spine locked a very difficult move to pull off and it takes a long time to master the steps it takes a long time to understand the position so this guy learned it and then a couple days later claimed to have pulled it off in Thailand  and it was like it's like one of those scenes in a movie with a record scratches and everybody just goes what and I remember we were like what's going on so then my friend winds up rolling with him rolling his sparring it's you do Jiu Jitsu rolling and he comes back to me and goes there's no fucking way that guy's black belt it doesn't even make sense he goes he's like he doesn't know what the fuck he's doing like this is really weird so he winds up having this conversation  National conversation with them on the phone while I'm in the car is talking to him and he goes I want to know what you are because you're not a fucking black ball so tell me what's going on it says he no no my black belt in Japanese Jiu-Jitsu it's different it's not time goes out what he tells got to go fuck himself time goes on the guy winds up killing someone he winds up murdering this girl that he's having sex with murdering her husband and he gets caught driving around hurt his car  the guys car after he's killed the guy and then he winds up trying to recruit a friend to kill someone it's like this whole big thing and he winds up going to jail and he's in jail now but I remember thinking okay you don't know shit about catching and spotting Liars because you didn't you didn't spot that guy's being completely full of shit like I thought it was a little full of shit but I didn't know he was a like a complete sociopath and a murderer yeah so this is an interesting question  using that scenario would you have done a better job if all I gave you was the transcript of this guy speech so there's this is a there's a lot of interest in this question the community people who study deception so there's many different I can suppose I'm trying to improve my ability to spot lies I can we can do three things I can listen to you face-to-face as you're telling me something as either true or false I can we  this entirely on the telephone so I don't see you I just hear you or I can just read the transcript of what you say and try to decide whether it's true or false and it seems to be the case that we're better when we just when we remove Sight and Sound and all we have are this the word to plain words on the page there was the nurse what being present does is it introduces all kinds of  of noisy information that just distracts us from the core question of whether the truth is being told so maybe it was maybe if all you had was a transcript and as this guy is describing this particular what was the name of the movie Twister the Twister maybe as you're looking at the way he described and all you're doing is focusing on the precise way in which he describes this very very intricate move and you would realize oh he actually doesn't understand what he's talking about and you would have seen it clearly in that moment if you but maybe there was something  this presentation that threw you off the scent it was the move itself it see because if he just said oh I got it I got the guy in an armbar well a lot of people catch people in our bars it's a very common move you learn it first day of Jiu-Jitsu yeah you can catch someone someone makes a mistake in your white belt and they reach up and you grab their arm you can catch an armbar yeah Twisters very difficult to pull off very difficult yeah it's only been done in the UFC  maybe once I think Chan sung Jung the Korean zombie pulled it off once he may be the only guy maybe one other guy ever yeah sky was delusional that ever so it was it was horseshit and the only thing that we were taking into consideration like he was fight supposedly fighting in Thailand which turns out there was no fight at all he's a complete liar yeah the only thing that we were taken into consideration was maybe this guy fought a scrub like he could have fought someone who really didn't know anything and he said let me try the Twister on them  but then that's like you have to be beating the guy so badly you just would end the fight you wouldn't do a twister on him the only time you do a twister as if you're a highly skilled Grappler and you think you could put someone into position that they don't understand because it's a confusing position it's a position that there's a common position called back Mount where you would choke someone or you would transition to other moons from there and he was almost there but not quite there because you're caught you're kind of on the side so even season Grapplers  really make mistakes and get caught in the Twister but you have to be a fucking wizard to pull that off on somebody yeah it's not something you have to be really good it's not something that you can just do so when he said he did it we were all like what it wasn't if he said he had kicked the guy knocked him out oh that well that happens all the time yes he punched a guy hit him with an elbow and cut them the referee stopped the fight all that stuff is real that happens all the time he chose this one signature move of my friend Eddie  and we were both like there's something wrong here man yeah something wrong here there's a hilarious version of the sun I'm a runner and I'm on all the running message boards as one called let's run which is system and they're constantly catching people who lie about their Marathon times it's hot it's a hilarious that well there's all kinds of reasons but a lot of it is it starts with the eyeball test so they'll be a you know because a lot of marathons have to take pictures of the participants at various points during the race and some will claim to run like  a 240 Marathon now 240 you did really good run it's not world-class learning beside very good to be serious to rent your foot so they'll eyeball someone who claims to run 242 say now I mean he's just looking at them 10:00 10:15 extra pounds right there they should be they should look like they've been running a little bit look totally fresh as a daisy right now they're what are they doing wearing those shoes no 240 marathon is like is that kind of processed and then because the second order where they do complicated  it analysis of splits and they do all this kind of thing but it often begins with the same thing it's like you just guys trying to claim to be this and say yeah no no that's right that's not working that's like a I love those Insider e well I have this thought about how much culture has shifted through the internet and how much cultural shift again in the even more astronomical way once we can read minds and I don't think we're far away from that I think we're a few decades away from some technology that allows  as people to establish intent and to see thoughts and I think they're very there's some sort of theoretical work they're doing on this right now and there's there's different models that they're trying to achieve I think that's going to eliminate a lot of the bullshit of communication and I think it's going to happen really quickly just like Google sort of eliminates a lot of the bullshit of people telling stories about something at some of those what what  wait a minute what year and they go good that didn't happen and they can find out like almost instantaneously I think we're going to be able to figure that out with people I think there's going to be a way where you can where we can see intent and we can read minds I don't think we're far away from that yeah I mean I know this neural link thing with Elon Musk is very elon's very hush-hush about this is different sort of electronic brain interfaces that they're trying to  experiment with yeah I wouldn't wouldn't you worry be that if we read were able to read someone's thoughts mmm intentions what we would in fact discover is even more confusing than what we know now in other words maybe what's inside my head right now are 35 different thoughts and intentions warring at with each other murder scenarios yes mercenary then Malcolm just sort of keeps everything everything I'm Thomas surface supernormal  I think it's totally true think about it most of us there's any number of things think about that yeah the list of the list of possible things that could come out of my mouth at this very moment is infinite right it is infinite there are at this very moment God knows how many scenarios swirling around my head about what should I say next right and why is my intention to try and make you laugh to impress you to piss you off to disagree with you II agree with you I mean if we can  go on and on and on all those are in play so you really want to look inside my head and get you're not going to get clarity he's going to be a mess or we're going to realize we're all a mess yes like it would make us feel a little bit better like oh everybody's out of their fucking mind but would you want that yes you would yes I'm endlessly curious about I know my mind is such a mess there's so much chaos going on there I want to know what's going on other people's I want to know how fucked up am I alright  my normal is it so standard here's my fear I've many fears about this kind of thing but my fear would be as follows that I cannot count the number of times when I have had reactions to things that people have said in the moment that turn out to be wrong deeply in badly wrong and one of the things that I have learned as an adult is too deeply distressed those kinds of reactions and to wait and very often what will happen in my case sometimes the waiting takes a long time  I'm the kind of person who sometimes a month will pass and I will think back on a situation and I'll think oh my God I totally misunderstood that this person who I thought was a jackass is actually someone you know a lovely person who I should give a second chance to or whatever that comment that someone made that I thought was stupid is in fact extremely thoughtful and insightful this will happen weeks months later whatever if you were able to read my  mind in the moment you would judge me for my mistake and not give me an easy way to correct it and it was you trap me in like what if this would have had a reaction to something you said in this conversation which I've said Jesus can't believe that that's dumb and then I'm driving back to LA tonight and I think oh actually oh that's really interesting and thought about the time I don't want you to short-circuit my learning process about you I want I want to give me the  of my my six hours of thinking about what you said and allow me give me that kind of time to come to a reason that insightful conclusion about how I feel that's interesting but we're talking then about only one person having the technology because if you both have the technology and there wouldn't be any issue you wouldn't be confusion as to why someone was saying something you'd be--you'd you have a much clearer path to understanding their thought process and their intent behind it really  yes get a mean if one person has it right then yeah I get it yeah if I can read your mind oh I said something and Malcolm thinks I'm a retard like you know there's that but there's another there's another possibility that both people have it and this is also one of the things that would be fascinating about this is one of the things about forbidden words is forbidden words carry with them intent they have automatic intent right but you can say  the exact same word and have different intent behind it if we could understand clearly what your intent is then taboo words would automatically become meaningless it wouldn't mean it's not about sound you make it's not about forbidden sounds always what it's about is thoughts yeah and what you're trying to convey and what's happening to you as a human being who are you like what what what is your process for the way you communicate what is your process for the way  you're trying to develop these thoughts in your mind and express them to people well well part of the problem with that is language right and part of the problem with making certain aspects of our language forbidden is you limit people's ability to colorfully communicate and express themselves in certain ways I think that alone just eliminating that alone eliminated in confusion and also highlighting you know you could highlight real  homes with people's thoughts in the way people communicate but also eliminate many problems so you'd say oh he doesn't mean that like you could see what he means like this is what this is where his mind is you could see you could literally see the thoughts yeah yeah I guess I would also let me let me get let me throw another complicating Factor it still leaves the question of cultural context yes of course one of the things I got really interested when I was writing my book was how our kind of cultural frames of  reference profoundly complicate our attempts to understand other people and so in your scenario where I have some kind of window into your thinking and intention I still need to know in order to make sense to you I still need to have a very clear idea of the cultural kind of rules of the road that you're using and they're likely to be different from mine and or particularly if you know I mean I'm a Canadian you're not but imagine if the  between us was more profound if rise you know then you still like like I was is a really cool thing I've been obsessed with with memory I'm doing things I'm memory in my in revision history this coming season and I was reading about this really fascinating experiment which is done with Korean and American college students adults essentially and what I do is I give you three circles  paper circles and one is past when its present when his future and I say those are three concepts represent those three concepts with these three circles so the American kid has passed here present in the middle future over on the right three independent circles the green kid puts all piles all three circles on top of each other  now what does that mean I don't know what that means it means something interesting right it means that they don't they're not separating these three modes the way that we are there certainly coming at experience with a very different set of assumptions so maybe so I think of the Civil War is a long time ago but if I'm Korean maybe the Civil War is as present in My Kind Of Consciousness is something that happened last week is that maybe that's not what that means I'm not exactly sure I'm sort of guessing  because I don't know the I haven't fully investigated but the point is there are I've just given you one random example there are a great way incredibly different rules that different cultures use to organize experience so if I'm looking at  you and reading your thoughts I have to know those rules because those rules are sorting out how people so this is only this is not I'm not to I'm not dissing this notion of that you're talking about I'm saying that it needs to have another layer as well a cultural Earl a cultural are which kind of alerts me to how you're organizing experience not certainly makes sense it's it's interesting when you think about like the Tower of Babel write like this this idea that one  in time everyone spoke the same language and God sort of set it up so that it was we're never going to be able to really communicate with each other because everybody has a bunch of different languages and we'll never figure it out that was that's the sort of crunched up version of it if there was a way to change the way like all languages are essentially little symbols that are written down on paper or typed out and then sounds you make with your mouth and they convey intent  if there was a way to do another version of language a universal version of language that's eventually adopted but I'm reading this book about these people that were kidnapped by Native Americans and they were assimilated into the tribes they learn the language and is happen over a course of a couple of years and I was thinking like what would that be like if you you know that's how you learn a language or kidnapped by you know what I mean yeah like you got but if there was a new language  how long would it take for adults to learn a new language if someone came up with a new language of completely Universal characters and this language is conveyed through this technology rather than through your mouth so it's your your your thoughts your thoughts interface with some sort of Technology it creates whatever hieroglyphs some sort of visual language that we all agree upon and then this is universal this is you  Universal throughout all cultures yeah and the only thing that we'd be confused about assumptions and rules as far as like what's okay well you could do that can't you can't we kind of do that already in a sense that we could have a universal language and then we have a device you know sitting on our phone or something yeah that when we I'm in you know I'm in some for I'm in Bulgaria and I'm ordering coffee I speak into the device and it simply translates either translates  directly in the Bulgarian that's actually not that hard no or it translates this into this common language that the Bulgarian translator services and if you think of the technology at a slightly more advanced level than it is now it could be done in a very seamless way like it doesn't have to be some bulky box it could literally be that I am speaking in English and what you're hearing is there's a filter and what you're what you're hearing is this other language I mean  well don't don't Google buds or whatever they are there they are you know they are pod version of those Google things I think there's something some technology that actually enables you to instantaneously translate that yeah there's some doing for you yeah I know you hate for Google to have one more thing over us right it's like not enough that they should control 9/10 of our life yeah well so going to let them control our communication I remember as a kid we days to love Doonesbury did you reduce yes  is a hilarious thing and Doonesbury where I forgot who uncle duke or somebody is going to China and his uncle Duke Hunter has Thompson yeah he was and he was appointed Ambassador I think he was imported American ambassador to China and its and that was a joke and he would go and he would meet with like the head of the president China and he would say the most incredibly incendiary outrageous things and the translated never translated what he said would turn he would say this rageous offensive thing and the translator is saying you know  the flowers are blooming today I just thought I was hilarious yeah Jamie had a thought once that hieroglyphs 420 2019 are essentially emojis oh yeah it's kind of  I mean what's your sort of was saying yeah like the internet you have to translate English into bits in order for the computer to translate it into an emoji it's almost I feel like that's almost what you're saying although it's not exactly it's a Bing is a beginning step yeah it's exam 1 2 yeah it just seems like this is not the best we can do North noises with your mouth and then you know learning English is incredibly complicated for someone who speaks Mandarin and vice verse yeah you know it's all very  very what if we all said hey look this is some new version of a language like whenever there's a whether it's contact or whenever the some movie about extraterrestrials though is a team of scientists and linguists and Geniuses to get together and they go look we're going to establish a universal language they communicate with these people and Close Encounters of the Third Kind it was music du du du didn't do that they would figure out some way we're going to figure out a way to talk if we  had some enormous Financial incentive or some enormous crisis was in playing we had to all communicate with the same language and so remember when they were trying to push the while you're from Canada the metric system was actually real over there was very little that was in high school they were trying to push the metric system yeah and I remember there was like a concerted effort they're like we're going to have to learn the metric system Goods the universal system at the whole world uses an they gave up the United States gave up what  why was this possible in Canada and not possible in the United States because we're assholes you guys are 20% less assholes at least 20% there I don't know how's that possible I've always thought because I grew up in Boston which is also cold I've always thought cold weather made assholes because it's like you just like fuck it's called fuck that fuck you fuck you because Boston is filled with people that want to get drunk and fight and then the lot of them are really mean which is a great place to grow up you develop a thick skin and  you look like as a comedian it's a great place to start out and do comedy if you learn how to do it right I don't think Boston is mean because of the cold I think yeah I think he's Canadian well the coldest parts of Canada like you know I know lots of people lots of members of my family are from Winnipeg which is seriously cold nicest people nicest people yeah thanks doesn't make any sense it doesn't that's why I said it doesn't my theory sucks yeah - kids be children of very rough immigrants and they say  Aiden these communities and every ghost yes exactly that's what I am so the immigrants of these people that were willing to take a risk and get on a boat and there wasn't even YouTube videos to watch these are Savage people that made it over here and they're really rough and they had rough childhoods and they raised rough children and The Echoes of that persist on the east coast of the United States we the amount of drinking that went on in Irish  communities is it's funny cuz I stumbled across years ago I was I've always been obsessed with drinking alcohol affect have chapter that on it in this book but so years ago turns out that the place in America where alcohol studies as they're called we're really birthed was New Haven which makes person attitude yeah makes perfect sense so in the 50s a bunch of people get really really interested in understanding how drinking works and it in New Haven of course you have the perfect  because you have two very large groups of immigrants you have Irish Italians right in all of knowing that you've got those two to work with and of course they could not be more different in the way they drink so even in immigrant Italian communities in the 50s these are people who are in terms of volume of alcohol consumed way up at the top there drinking with every meal they're making you know why non from the backyards they are but the levels of alcoholism are  noticeable the amount of like social dysfunction associated with drinking Camp I mean it's just not as negligible these are the healthiest triggers you can imagine side by side are the Irish I don't need to tell you that story is very different let me actually what is it it's super interesting question you've got so they're not one groups not richer than the other they come to America not the same time but their 19th century early 20th century come to American law  numbers there are some you know Irish culture looks a lot too but it was Catholic right now to maybe Catholic in different ways but there's a sir on the surface these are you think that they would use the bottle in the same way no the Irish are the the Irish the men are slinking off to the pub and in Italy everyone's gathered around a steaming bowls of pasta and drinking like one and a half glasses of wine mild homemade wine with your dinner it's like night and day  yeah it's unbelievable is it because one is a whiskey culture because Whiskey's rough stuff I mean you really can't have much before you're off the rails yeah there's some of that yeah I did the the attachment to Wine in the Italian Community probably saves them a good deal of their of alcohol-related heartbreak I don't know too much about the actual is there a difference between the way different alcohol effects is the  is the wine alcohol actually affect you by volume by by by the actual percentage of alcohol does it affect you differently than beer or differently than whiskey or differently tequila because that's what people always say oh if I drink tequila I get crazy like people always have these stories but is that true if you have you had a certain percentage of alcohol if we equalize yes equalize the the alcohol concentration is it all the same in here yes because for me wine  wine makes me warm and friendly and it makes me sleepy and it mean it doesn't make me energetic whiskey makes me crazy like I think it's a crazy drug I think when people drink shots of Jack Daniels they just want to go whoa they want to get crazy want to do dumb shit it makes them want to do dumb things shots in particular makes people want to do dumb things makes people get crazy makes people loud it makes people Irish right  yeah it's better you saying well I'm swimming quarter Irish I can get away with it for a little while only a quarter that's it yeah mostly Italian oh I see you're at the cusp of these two drinking tradition yes yes oh I see but Rogan you're fool enough fresh you're fooling us with Rogan yes yes because we would think that you were majority Irish with that yes yeah and I could be dark Irish if you looked at me he would yeah I'm will I'm you know I am a reserved English  Jamaican Jamaicans not big drinkers in in the same kind of the difference actually fascinatingly of the many weird alcohol facts if you look at young people like let's like a college-age young people in America and look at their drinking habits the black students drink and get drunk markedly less than white kids real  all differences in drinking Behavior by race in that at that age Asian students don't drink much either drinking is like a it's like a it's like a white thing it's a crazy white thing increasingly enough or problematic drinking I've always thought that was fascinating this fascinating I don't know the I don't know why that's so as it's revered in our culture more it's yeah I mean getting fucked up is celebrated in white culture well this you know in the alcohol chapter of my book The  I talk about all the strange things that have happened with drinking patterns on campus and I was struck in doing that chapter I was interested in the connection between drinking and drunkenness in sexual assault on campus Because all of those the overwhelming majority if you talk to people who study sexual assault on campus they will tell you that you almost never see one of these cases where both parties aren't drunk right it's which doesn't explain  in them entirely but it's a huge factor in making sense of what happens and when you dig into that you see these like really weird patterns first off when I was in college I did not know and I went to college in Canada not a teetotaling population I did not know a single person who's ever been drunk blackout drunk  and then now if you talk to a 20 year old college student in America they will name friends of theirs who get blackout drunk on a weekly basis what is the drinking age in Canada and what was it when you were in college what has it cause you was 18 yeah I think that might be a big factor I've been talking to friends about this about Europe about how in Europe particularly in Italy and France you're allowed to drink wine at a very young age yeah and the taboo  to aspect of it the forbidden fruit all that goes away it's a just it's a I don't think young kids should be drinking because I think it's terrible for your brain development but I think there's a thing in keeping them from drinking or making it illegal where it becomes so taboo and so intoxicating that they can't wait until they can legally do it or they try to get ahold of it before it's legal and it has a certain excitement to it that just doesn't it doesn't have in  it's of Europe yeah you've given it up kind of so there's all kinds of the things that are new are way less beer and way more hard liquor so hard liquor when I was in school and Canada in the 80s 95% of what we drank was beer it's just not there wasn't any whiskey or even or tequila or a vodka in our party's it's just beer beer kegs keg parties yeah really hard to get blackout drunk on beer I mean black out to get the blackout you've got to be you got to get  like I forgot what the exact number that and drinks or something well it's point you gotta blow like .18 or something I forgotten with us have a magic number where people set for everybody because some people they just get dribble eyes like there's some dudes they'll have a couple of drinks and they get shark eyes you know those those dark like expressionless eyes like hey man you still here yeah like they're just wandering around like like a like a person with doll eyes there's with the issues in there with your shoes back on his just I'll point  does your hippocampus shut down and you cease to be able to have the ability to make memories so that's just that's a very narrow clinical explanation of so they may be a whole different set of manifestations of drunkenness that have to do with alcohols effect on other parts of your brain right the blackout is just about your hippocampus and past a certain blood alcohol concentration your hippocampus just goes offline essentially you just pull the plug on the end cap and then so  and it's coming in is being stored wow so you can continue to communicate I could be blackout drunk right now but does it vary with people does it the number well so yes it would it would it would vary depending I think I'm drinking history in yeah but I mean as a there is it's there's a kind of a there's a consensus figure where most people I wish I it's in my book I wish I could remember I think it's something like .16 or something like that  that if you think of the if the lab the level legal level for drinking forums for driving is .08 I think it's roughly 2x that level and most people at that level will be at risk we'll have at least the beginnings of memory impairment so that feeling when you get really drunk at a party and the next morning you can only remember little bits and pieces of what happened that night that's because your your hippocampus was posed at your moment of peak intoxication your hippocampus was  going to shut down and just wasn't taking any new members really interesting too because some of our most interesting minds and some of the best communicators relied on alcohol heavily Mike and it made that like Hitchens made him a more interesting Communicator when he was drunk when he would have a drink you know I mean right like you would be on Bill Maher you could tell he was he was lit and and and he was so eloquent and so  slit but that beautiful phrasing so remember though that's his an interesting point and a crucial point about blackout which is your hippocampus doesn't necessarily control your your how articulate you are how fluid your speeches it's just about memory so Hitchens could have been the most articulate person in the world in just and but the next morning he would not have remembered a single thing he said on Bill Maher I mean I'm assuming if he was drunk he was black out no but but you don't know this fascinating stories in the literature about  but when people were discovering blackout in the 50s and they would they would be these stories like they would some guy would come in would wake up in Las Vegas and he would say what am I doing in Las Vegas like and they would go and he would see his clothes hanging in the closet and he would say what is going on and then he would like go down to the desk and say what and it's all you checked in last night and he would look in his wallet and he would see you get a plane ticket from Cleveland and they would reconstruct and is a  in fact this very story was told in the one of the big sites medical journals in the 50s the guy reconstructs he's a Salesman living in like st. Louis who gets really really drunk and then his hippocampus shuts down and he continues to function so it goes gets in his car drives to the airport buys a plane ticket goes to Vegas does he does notice in Vegas does whatever he does in Vegas and then wakes up like two days later oh my God hippocampus is suddenly back online what am I doing in Vegas that  two days two days so what is like what is it you can you like that was my point I could be black out right now and still communicate and you wouldn't know it I don't it's not like you can tell I can't tell whether you have a headache can I write no clue so you don't know what's going I mean until we come up with that machine that you were talking about you can't tell that my hippocampus isn't working except if you answer if you ask me the same question this is how you the only way you can do it you had a party you think someone's  blackout ask them the same question over and over again and see if they respond like say why are you asking me so literally I would say wait did you say you heard you're a quarter Irish and then I would just have to wait like say five seconds and say Joe did you see her a quarter Irish and in a certain way you say Malcolm white stop it if you don't say that your blackout drunk but if you do if you could you be blackout drunk and still have like a  tiny memory well he may just ask me that okay so the hippocampus doesn't shut down all at once so what it does is it shuts down slowly so let's imagine we're both doing shots so after I mean I'm quite sure your capacity I'm I mean you're like I'm half your weight am I but I don't know what you are you're like 200 pounds I'm 126 okay so we're going to deal with alcohol very differently but let's assume we're doing shots of tequila  but there's a point where things start to get hazy so you might remember that I asked you that question you might not and then as we keep drinking in our blood alcohol levels get higher and higher at a certain point your hippocampus will completely like the off switch has been thrown so it goes from being sluggish and impaired to just being down like and what brings it back  well you're out but alcohol level has to fall to the point where it can work again so you fall asleep and over the course of eight hours of sleep you know your alcohol is processed by your liver blood alcohol Falls hippocampus snaps back into action wow what a ridiculous drug to be our most socially acceptable drug totally and then the Vegas thing where they give it to you for free of course the in a place where you can gamble which is really sneaky  yeah that's one of the weirder laws ever that a person could literally lose their house while they're blackout drunk crazy I mean in retrospect imagining you were were we let's do a little ranking thing here we have three vices and I'm I know exactly where you're going to be going with this but we have three things we want to prioritize dope alcohol  smoking right cigarettes cigarettes you can ban one actually rank them in order you could we can start from scratch I'm saying Joe was starting over okay what you say goes rank new week so right now The Way We have dealt with these is smoking is is becoming the most taboo of those three cigarettes mmm marijuana second and alcohol is the one that we have the least  Innovations about right my argument would be that that list is exactly backwards  that it should be alcohol should be the most taboo marijuana should be actually not exactly backwards it should be alcohol the most taboo cigarettes the second most marijuana the third that's how I would do yeah I would agree with that yeah yeah so we're basically we have it completely upside down but I think for some people  like  look there's obvious obviously terrible things that happen to you when you smoke cigarettes but every time is it is it pot I see I've smoked a cigarette or two before shows like I've smoked a city I mean or two I've never smoked two in a row but I've smoked a cigarette before I've done shows like Dave Chappelle gave me one of his cigarettes recently Tony hinge Clips give me a cigarette I'm not a cigarette smoker but there's something cool about the Head Rush that you get when you smoke a cigarette I  Tate to say that this is a person who's done a lot of drugs I've done a lot of smoked a lot of pot and I've done psychedelics and I'll talk about them openly I have hesitation about telling people that I have enjoyed a cigarette well because because it's because I think it's so bad for you it's I think when I talk about doing mushrooms I think mushrooms are good for you I think it makes you freak out I think it it illuminates parts of your Consciousness that I think a lot of  guard and protect and shield and I think sometimes doing something that breaks down those walls is good for you ultimately overall there's a little bit of an adjustment period but I think you learn something about the normal State of Consciousness I don't think you learn much when you smoke cigarettes I just think there's this a little bit of a Head Rush that you get out of it but I know so many people that are sick from cigarettes so many people that can't quit them so many people that have died from cancer I mean I personally have known  several people that have died from cancer from smoking cigarettes yeah so I hesitate in saying it but I don't want to be dishonest I've had them yeah I don't smoke cigarettes though I've never bought a pack of that's a cigar smoke cigars I like them sometimes I just think it's a terrible it's a terrible thing to get hooked on yeah yeah and as I would say the same thing with alcohol I know people that have had real problems with alcohol that have been alcoholics and  they have to go to the meetings and you know they're on 12-step programs and you know I would never offer them a drink but if you said hey let's do a shot right now let's celebrate with is a wonderful conversation let's have a glass of whiskey I can have a glass of whiskey and not drink again it doesn't bother me okay I don't have that whatever that is yeah but some people do yeah I hesitate hesitating glorifying that to yeah and for young people scares the shit out of me if I see I've  we drank for the first time when I was probably like I was in high school I think is probably 14 or 15 first time I ever got drunk with my friends you know we got ahold of some Jack Daniels or something and maybe throw us the Irish legal drinking age yes well it's just friends you know listening to Classic Rock and getting drunk in Boston but the it's it's something I occasionally enjoy I enjoy alcohol I like having a drink of wine with a glass of wine with a meal  I like having a drink with friends occasionally but I don't have a problem with it and I know people who do and so I feel weird talking about it knowing those people that do have a problem with it yeah yeah with pot though the people that have a problem with pot it's rare and it's usually people that have some sort of a nun I do believe there there is an issue with people having some sort of an underlying schizophrenic issue that could come from especially high doses if they smoke  a lot of pot and one night they can have a schizophrenic episode I've actually seen it particularly from Edibles have seen it but that's to me that's absolutely the least taboo and I think there's a lot of benefits to pot I think Pop makes you more sociable I think it makes you friendlier maybe some people get paranoid from it but I think that's what that really is is marijuana Illuminating how vulnerable you actually are yeah that we sort of protect ourselves from this overwhelming exes  tential angst that you get when you get high on pot yeah and people say I don't like it makes me paranoid well you know the reality is You're vulnerable we're all very very very vulnerable and we just somehow another make it to look how old are you 56 I'm 52 we made it we made it to Sage somehow or another despite all the paranoia we got here we don't have to I mean it's like really you know life is crazy we're in these metal boxes with combustion engines you know like  trusting the people next to us going 60 miles an hour paying attention not looking at their phone you know it's like it's very very well and then weekend planes and who knows the fuck's going on with the engine this guy's flying it over the sky it's we're very vulnerable all the time just diseases and you know not to mention you know war and all sorts of other things that could fall where it all right yeah I mention everything earthquake fire yeah fires yes no my my thing on this  it is simply the collateral damage yeah the so leave the individual out of it and ask how much Social damage is caused by any of those things and got an alcohol and act number one just by the five Bible yeah you don't make it you know what's amazing to me is how the people who make alcohol have get a free ride it's incredible to me that like if I said to you that I was on the board of Philip Morris you would say that's not  it's pretty screwed up yeah and you would see would be you know problem with it if I said that I'm you know I'm on the board of Anheuser-Busch you probably would hit me up for tickets to the Super Bowl hmm right this is that see where is there's no in terms of the amount of social damage what out what Anheuser-Busch has created has produced a hundred times the social damage then what Philip Morris is produced yeah right like you know so it's like it's five always puzzled but I don't know how it got in our heads like  to treat one like it's completely taboo and the other we kind of shrug you know the there are a bunch of was reading about this recently how many colleges accept not just accept alcohol advertising and sponsorship but you go to a college football game and you know Bud Light will have will be an active sponsor of the event will have some huge relationship with the school this is crazy  he's crazy writers like this is the drug that is causing so many problems for young people particularly on campuses and the schools are hand in glove with the manufacturers of it because it's socially acceptable because it off to worry about repercussions because we give it up we give it a flick and the way that they would never have Marlboro Marlboro yeah oh my God people would pick it yeah whereas it's not you know I don't know this is true the strange kind of we were so messy people are so messy and that is it  that's a very good example of how messy we are  do you I'm I'm now  I didn't really for some reason I hadn't realized you were from Boston why are so many comics from Boston it's a hard place is that what it mean women drunk guys there's no am I right am I right in thinking there just seemed to be like why is it every time I turn around and I listened to some comic and they say well when I was growing up in Boston I'm of course your father's a lot it's a lot there's a lot and there are specific kind of its like the audience is there have a very short attention span  they are they're not going to coddle you if you suck they will boo you off the stage it's terrible for your self-esteem when you're young yeah but it feels good but it's it doesn't just build character it builds the correct approach towards an audience that you have to realize these people do not let these people got babysitter's they spent money they're here they could have been in the movie they could have done a lot of the recreational activities they've chosen to come to the comedy club stop fucking around get to work like like treat this like this is and the consequences of  of bombing of horrific right the feeling is it's one of the worst feelings a person can have yeah so we when was the last time you bombed it's been a while since I bombed but I've heard jokes that ate shit yeah well that's this is there's a process that I go through every two years I put out a special and then I write a new one and during the process of writing a new one you don't write it in a vacuum you write it and then I bring that stuff to The Comedy Store and fortunately with The Comedy Store you're doing 15 minutes Etc  with you know 15 other talented people so you you don't have to be up there for a long time and you get it in the comp the comic store also the audience is very unique in that a lot of them understand that they're going to see these guys like Dave Chappelle and Chris Rock and workout comedy how I see they know it's working properly understand that and like you could joke around about it like that bit sucks I swear to God it's going to be good in about four months Tippets that bits in the oven right now because  Concepts that you have that you go there's got to be a way to make this work but that way that I just did is not the way you always trust the reaction you get another words you don't tell a joke it bombs and you say actually I think it was their problem not mine never that's never their problem there's not a chance in hell you can have a bad audience where a good joke doesn't go over because they're drunk and they're not paying attention to their heckling that's possible yeah but that's the anomaly the it's if you have a bit and you think it's a great been the audience doesn't laugh  laughs they're right you know maybe another audience would laugh maybe you're doing it in the wrong demographic or what have you but most likely that joke sucks yeah and most likely you have these ideas and you need to figure out how to rework them like Chris Rock told me that that he's at his that famous bit that I love black people I hate the n-word right that bid he said it took him a year to work out a  year he said it was bombing he couldn't get it to work right it will fuck up his act but he knew there was a way to do it and then it became one of the greatest bits of all time it became this incredible classic bit but that was from him grinding just chipping away at it reworking it bringing it on stage it eats shit you bring it back you go over it you ponder it you ask questions of other great writers like what do you think you know and they're like well I've been test maybe that and then you try it again  and it keeps doing it he did does it a hundred times or 200 times and then eventually it becomes bulletproof and then he gets it down to that form that you see it on his comedy special where it's just boom punchline bam punchline boom punchline bam and people like that because it's so good but there's a process to doing that and sometimes you have this idea in your head and you like I think there's something there I don't know I just got to figure out how to get into their head yeah and then I got to figure out how to make it in a way what's the most power  we'll wait for people to digest this idea because comedy is essentially a massive gnosis right you're getting the audience to allow you to think for them for a brief period of time and so if you're at your best the punchlines are sneaky they come where you don't expect them you take people on this ride they're assuming because they letting you think for them that you're a thoughtful person you're not going to make them feel bad for liking you and that's one thing that people really hate you say something mean or something thoughtless you portray  yeah yeah you betrayed their trust because they've trusted you to think for them yeah so you have to be considerate about people's sensibilities and feelings you know and when you're especially when you're breaching a sensitive issue like it you have to you have to dance you have to do you have to figure out a way to make this thing compatible to people thought patterns it's funny I you know I don't I'm not a stand-up comedian but I give a lot of speeches like in in conferences and  puppies headings which is a very in some ways a very different animal in some ways quite a similar animal and I've been doing it for 20 odd years now and the thing I'm always that blows me away is how different audiences are hmm like and one thing that you after doing it for about 10 years you start to get a little bit smarter about reading the room at the beginning to know who they  they are and what and it's you know it makes a difference like there are some some audiences are generous and they will if they see the the my case the punchline is not necessarily a joke but it's the payoff to whatever story I'm telling some people when they see it coming if you think about as a line they'll reward you the minute they see it they see it off in the Horizon yeah and I'll be like oh it's coming and they encourage you yes yes some people  we'll wait until the last possible moment and in some people will wait a beat after the punch line is over and then think about it and reward you those three audiences make that makes a world of difference in how you tell the story in your expectation going in in you know because if you if you think it's an early rewarding audience and it's a late rewarding audience you can get you'll be 10 minutes in and you're totally bummed out because you think it's a disaster but in fact it's not like and then  you get I develop all of these short hands about audiences I don't know if they're true or not but in my experience I remember once giving a talk to a group of Engineers on a early on a Monday morning in Minneapolis in February so it's freezing it's 8 o'clock in the morning they're engineers and they're all white guys they're like Norwegian right an incredibly thoughtful interesting audience listened to every word but they are not going to reward you  until they have thought about what you said and they'll wait like you know there's a five second lag between whatever payoff you give and their response right if you go I've also give it a talked to like a group of teachers in New Orleans so there you have a room that is largely female that would be much more diverse so maybe 50% black for example 20 percent Hispanic 30% white just way more they're going to reward  Lord you the minute they see it coming their teachers first of all so their whole thing is about listening rewarding you know seeing the best in something and celebrating it I mean completely different if you go into the engineers in Minneapolis and the teachers in New Orleans with the same expectation you're going to it's going to be a disaster yeah right teachers just want to find a way to love you right and and also their women women I think my experience are far more  generous than men as audience I don't know if overall yeah probably yeah but so that like and I took a long time to figure that out because you for the longest time I would walk away from someone I would think from some toxin would think I just did committed the worst possible offense you're doing a different thing though it's your dance is very different write your first of all you're giving these speeches and you're doing it in these corporate environments you're doing it in conference rooms I would imagine and a different  and of halls and yeah Bright Lights yeah I'm doing it at comedy clubs theaters in arenas so comedy clubs they know what they're getting into their in and it's set up like if you go to the comedy store or the Improv right it's a low ceiling it's a great hot mic is great sound system there's opening acts that warm everybody up before I get there the stage is set and it's an  Armament that it's been established for decades this is a place to go to hear people tell jokes yeah you're doing it you're it's a your you don't have an opening acts you're doing it they don't even know if you're going to be funny they don't know what you're going to do you're going to talk yeah you got to talk about they've been sitting in the same air conditioned arena for six hours one small break I mean it's like they're and this thing to really doing work like yes you know so it's a it is a very very different yeah it's a super interesting  Ting I find it incredibly rewarding and I also find it it's sort of it reaffirms my my my kind of faith in humanity for some reason interesting I really I'm very very happy that I started doing sir doing it years and years ago but just to communicate with large groups of people that reaffirms her faith in what way because I'm always struck by how open I think a lot of the rhetoric in our society now about how Divided We Are  and level that I just think it's I think we're divided online on any talk to people person to person we find a way to find Common Ground yeah and you go to these meetings and you know that half of the room voted one way another half voted the other way and that doesn't come up right doesn't block half of you from appreciating have them appreciating what you're saying they're totally open to to As Long As You Are respectful and take the time to explain what you think and why and what and how it matters to them  them then people will listen and engage in ask really good questions and I don't see so funny the Washington is divided and online is divided I don't I just don't see it else mmm maybe I'm not getting a an accurate picture of the whole country but in in these you know give a talk at the group of whatever Educators in New Orleans yay you don't see this I think when it comes to political discussions that's when people get really divided because I think they feel like  supposed to be divided as really interesting video that I watched yesterday where Donald Trump jr. was getting heckled by these alt-right characters from not being right wing enough I was like holy shit like this this but I I took a lot of pleasure in watching that play out not because I want Donald Jr to get heckled but because this is what I've always said there's people that are just extreme and it doesn't matter if they're in antifa or if  are in the proud boys if they're far left or far right it's the same thing they're just finding an ideology and they're taking it to the extremists level and they're angry at the people aren't woke enough or they're finding an ideology and they take it to the first level and they're angry people that are not separatists that aren't white supremacist they're angry people that like Mexicans at all the any Mexicans I mean there's there's people that are that racist that are mad at subtle racism they're mad at people that there's just people that are  dream and you can't make everyone happy it is impossible and some people don't want to be happy they want to find ways in which you're not woke enough there they're concerned is not the overwhelming good of the world Harmony peace love compatibility communication and Community that's not their concern is their concern is finding ways you're wrong so finding ways that they're right and ways that you're that you're wrong so they'll  they'll find some reason why you're not woken up so it who my response to that was it was slightly different although I think a lot of what you're saying is accurate the reason they got upset with him was that he wouldn't do a QA yes okay yes okay now as someone who's on his book tour and is done been doing this for 20 years let me just say you have to do the QA yeah the QA is symbolically crucial it's like everyone says okay everyone sees you get up there and you  you are prepared bit and I was like okay fine I know you can do your prepared bit but you're asking me to spend $20 on a book on what I want to know is are you someone who is meaningfully engaged in the ideas that you're talking about in your book right so QA is where you prove that to me yes proving your thoughtful prove you care about the stuff prove that you wrote this in someone else didn't prove all those things yeah he wouldn't do it sorry thought it was weird because he just did the view which is like the  the worst way to have a QA I had fun of you but I'm saying in that situation there's everyone's talking everybody over everybody yeah you really don't get a chance to express full thoughts yes yeah if he can hear you if he could do the view he can still be do Q&A at you floozy UCLA forgotten what was it was it really was it but what was interesting too is that what he was using as an excuse was that the the the left-wing media is going to take  his quotes and take them out of context dude I said I've no sympathy for him well in that case no didn't make any sense doesn't make any sense like any sense just say something intelligent and meaningful and you'll be taken seriously that's the way the world works well there's a whole video I mean if someone takes it out of context you could always like show the entire video hey that's out of context here's why is he playing the helpless credits and he's not wear this thing well I mean I someone who's in you know like I said in Arabic I got no sympathy for that either that's what you  that's what you do listen I have no sympathy for me either in that in this case I do not think it's it's been found it very amusing his wife or girlfriend forgotten what she is which of those things she is she she then disses The Crowd about how the only the only way they could get dates is online because nobody would do you see that it's like rule number two after rule number one is do the QA rule number two is don't diss The Audience by by telling them they're all losers like it's just not what do you  well this piece you know that's a thing where people want to just get get you you got them so they want to get you people are booing fuck you you're a loser no no is there a loser yeah you know it's just noises instead of going love love you have a good one guys take care but instead you're right do the QA instead don't don't don't even you know it's not that hard to answer questions I think there's a real problem with answering questions in front of a crowd  though where people screaming out things I think real thoughtful conversation should be had one-on-one and it's it what if like we you and I having this conversation it's great but if there was a third person they're talking to we would have to work that guy in or that girl in we'd have to figure out when she's talking when we're talking and if you got another person okay now you got a real problem now you have four people and it's very difficult if you watch those panel shows some for some reason the network news shows post-election pre-election their  they've still haven't figured that out they'll get seven people on they think it's like more the merrier and like the like the pregame shows on NFL Sunday thanks I got so many guys each one of them says once at us and they're talking over each other and everybody's trying to get a sound bite off everyone has this prepared thing this is zanger I'm going to get that Trump guy with this one and they're ready for it and they trying to interject in someone's talking over them and excuse me I'm talking and then it degrades we have been I want to use the opportunity of being on the show to issue a challenge to double jump  Junior oh like just call me up done and I will accompany you on your book tour and interview want you onstage respectfully will do let's let's do a QA you and me ask you questions I'll do it do you want to do that yes that's something you want to do why do you want to do that I think will be fun what do you think it'd be fun about it well I think it would be in without saying anything that's going to know him to not do it okay yeah so let's be clear about a couple things Okay this not  it would not be a stunt I'm not doing it to do gotcha I would like to read his book thoughtfully and engage with him in the ideas in it and do we see for myself exactly thing I was talking about before is is he does he want to meaningfully engage with those ideas with someone who doesn't necessarily share them right right and that would be for its I would ask for an hour mmm and we can do it in lieu of audience Q&A if he likes I'll just have a  conversation with the Wednesday so just a conversation in front of an audience that would be interesting you don't you see that would you pay to see that yeah I would let's do a his book title is the same as my 2016 Netflix title it's triggered I got their first child on beach by three years that's question number one else they done I noticed that title of your book is the same as stove why are you biting Joe Rogan stuff what's going on over there he probably didn't know it existed  Marv almost released his HBO specials triggered to really yeah I was going to call it triggered to but at least he sent me an e-mail apologizing you know when you get it you want to get there early well you know it's not my term I wouldn't really care if Bill used it or if Donald Trump jr. used it we did obviously has he done or Dawn he's gone to feel calm Dawn that's good question isn't he Donald Trump jr. online but they think they distinguished the dad is Donald oh so they call him  him I don't know that's one of things I could ask presumably in our face off maybe we should do I my limiting it to an hour well yeah let's go Rogan rules let's go like two hours yes me and dodgy died in the second hour we really get into it yeah because that's what happens you could keep it together people can keep it together for 45 minutes you can't keep it together for 3 hours 3 hours you know who a person is you know I once gave a talk in Colombia and the Colombians are take themselves in the best way very seriously right they consider themselves  of the most cultured people do that America yeah they and their they can't they think they speak the most beautiful Spanish and I'm told they may as well they may well do and so I was talking with the was going to go this little kind of lecture tour of major Colombian cities and I was talking to the organizer and and text and a question you ask is well how long I should talk for some period of time and then we'll do qal how long do you think I should talk and the guy goes I don't know house three hours  he was dead serious and you realize like this is the same so when Fidel Castro would give those six hours speeches you realize it's not just I mean Castro a little bit crazy but there's also the our park there are cultures that have an expectation that if you're going to go and hear somebody speak it's not going to be over in 40 minutes right you have to commit to the to the experience and they literally want to me to start at 9 and ended noon weren't the early  campaign speeches for people running for president and the early days this country weren't they like that as well I believe there were long Affairs yeah and then then you get the Gettysburg Address which is what is it six minutes or something hmm so there's oh no what was it the inaugural I forgotten one of Lincoln's most famous speeches very brief is incredibly brief and you realize in that context where people are used to hours and hours and hours what an extraordinary mean it is think about Lincoln as a kind of  badass Entertainer not Entertainer performer so he walks into a world where everyone thinking they're going to be there for two hours he sets up there and he's done in five minutes you realize what a just a power move it is is that lastic like this is a good movie Magic him imagine him so he comes into his like AIDS and says this holds it up and it's you know you've seen it in the in the Lincoln Monument on the mall it's two paragraphs you know  Ford what is it I'm not Canadian four score and seven years ago yes blah blah blah blah blah two paragraphs they must have been like what these people traveled by horse and cart for hours to your USB connection yeah right yeah that's it such a great move it is a good move right we're still talking about it today yeah yeah it's unbelievably beautiful I every time I go to the Lincoln monument and read that I am moved to tears it is insanely gorgeous Bros as a writer  are you must appreciate like economy of words using the right words and the right place and having the right impact and my friend are he has a piece of paper that he has glued to the top of his laptop from Hemingway to quote says the first draft of everything is shit it's true and there's something about someone nailing writing someone just writing something that you go God damn he's just fucking nail that yeah  yeah there you have to maintain the trick is always even though it's false you have to you have to hold in your heart the conviction that there is a way to say this perfectly and beautifully yeah right you can so even when you're in draft one or two or five and it's not there yet you have to believe it's possible and the many you lose that belief that it's possible it's over here when you when you write do you write on paper first and then start typing  like how do you how do you opposite type and then print it out because there's there's certain things structural things you can only see I think when it's on the page and you've got to put all the pages in front of printed out though you don't write longhand at all dude print it out and then we'll I know then I will annotate that draft with a pen so I will do longhand absolutely there's a there there's a night I'm very I think that our thinking is actually quite sensitive to the  the mode that we're using yeah so you think differently when you're typing on a keyboard than when you have a pen in your hand and I think it's not a not one is better than the other they're both good they're just different and yes make sense to use both yeah I agree it's been particularly for me my notes before I go on stage I always write out longhand I mean right out I write my comedy though on my thoughts essay the writer Mall out on a keyboard I'd write typing and then when  about to go on stage like the hour or so before a show I'll write out index cards and sometimes I'll write out entire pits if it's a bit I'm working on and it's kind of new I'll write it all out and it helps tremendously with my memory yeah but something about writing things out but writing to me on paper is so slow it's so slow for me to actually write the words for me to get the thoughts out I want to get the thoughts out with a keyboard because I can just type I can do it quickly I can  get it done what I don't do what a lot of people do do is voice-to-text I don't do that never done that yeah but wait I have a question that occur to you when you saying you're talking about that schedule that you're on that you do us every two years we tell so are you starting when you when you have to sit down and write new material are you starting cold or do you have in the previous year where you can have building up little bits and pieces that you're now putting together yeah I always have little stuff that I lay aside  like I have I have pages and pages of shit that never went anywhere and so I'll go back over that and go man this maybe doesn't take that out there and then I'll introduce all so the usually there's a window of time like say if I my special I film it in July it might not are until August or until October rather so in that window I have those four months to try to create material so what I'll be able to do  in that window say I have a bit that I know works because it's on the special I'll do that bit because the people haven't seen it yet and then after that bit I will sandwich in some new stuff and I'll try to make that new stuff come alive and then I'll add a bit after that I know is good then I'll sandwich and some new salt get make like a like a club sandwich of shitty jokes it's sandwiched in between like legit bits and then one of them will catch fire oh my God this one's Alive Now good  you go back can you see a trajectory in your comedy like when you go back and look at something you were you were a joke that you may have done I don't know eight years ago do you how do you react to it does it I don't work I don't but if I did I probably somewhat I would definitely see flaws I would God that's too wordy or that's that's clunky or that's fit for store I don't like how I acted that out or I don't like maybe that wasn't done yet you know there's a there's a cooking period  added and everybody has a different take on it I've been my friend Anthony Jeselnik has a three year cycle and he might be right he takes the first year he just does clubs in LA and develops material the second year he goes on the road and he goes to comedy clubs in the road the third year he takes at the theaters and then he's ready to film at the end of the third year yeah and you know his last special was excellent but he's just very good comic very good writer but his process might be  right there's some guys that were doing it on a one-year cycle they were doing a new special every year and I don't think that's right that's got to be yeah it's too hard it's not just too hard the material suffers its half cooked a lot of his gooey on the inside it's just not ready yeah this is not done me some of the bits are really good then some of the bits aren't and you have to fill the whole hour and the problem is also when you're doing a special every year you have your own audience so those people love you so they're laughing at stuff that's not even that good  like you have to you have to be doing that in front of a bunch of people that didn't expect to see you yeah that's that's hard to do so a lot a lot of weird tricks you can play on yourself as a comic you know you could think you're better than you are or that the bits are better than they are or that you you don't have to worry about things anymore you don't have to grind you have to throw yourself into the Gladiator pit that is The Comedy Store in a Tuesday night but you do you do there's no other way if you want to be top-notch  have to do the things that top-notch people do there's a Sinister I mean there's no there's no books written on this there's no University course but all the best people will tell you there's a process this is the process you know it's one of the weird art forms in that no one teaches it there's litter anybody who does teach it is terrible there's no one who can this I've never seen like a we're real world class headliner sells out theaters who teaches a course on Comedy never  seen it you know and I couldn't teach you how to do it anyway because your way of doing it would be very different than Jamie's way of doing it which be very different than Steven Wright which is very different than Sam Kinison it's like everybody's got their own weird little thing that makes them funny it's a matter of what is the process how do you how do you get it out who is your candidate for I was loving any particular field there's the Insiders Choice and then there's the popular choice like the most hilarious one is if you ask an  protect who their favorite architect is 99 times out of a hundred you will never have heard of a Target it's always some obscure German guy from like the 30 you know or some like you know experimental Dutch guy who did not even one building and it's like amazing if you you know it's like some you need a church outside of Antwerp and it was it little ones my bag it's always that so who's the who's your insiders I would say The Insider a pic is Dave Attell  because Dave Attell is probably one of the greatest comics of all time it doesn't get enough love because he has no social media presence he wears the same hat and the same shirt and the same jacket and the same pants every day he does no thought whatsoever about his look all he does is just write new and better jokes constantly he's one of the most prolific Comics but he still still have a hard time selling places out and it doesn't make any sense although lately  he and Jeff Ross have done this thing called bumping Mike's where they go onstage and they sort of work together and they talk shit like Jeff will say something funny and then Dave will say something funny and Dave will do his bits and Jeff will make fun of them and they'll go and it's really entertaining and they do a series of shows doing that and that is elevated his profile and for that I'm very very thankful long was he survive in the wilderness he's been out there forever he's have a show on Comedy Central way back in the day called what was it goes on yeah insomnia thank you and it was like  he would go out after shows and they would you know go do weird things in these towns and he would get blackout drunk and he was an alcoholic at the time and he was getting hammered drunk and then he quit he got sober and rare in comedy that someone gets sober and becomes much better but that's what happened with Dave he's a much better comic now than even was then and what it so and what's your when you see someone like that perform and you're you  someone who was extraordinary talented and good what is your emotional reaction to it do you run home and re-examine all the stuff you're doing the I mean what's it certainly inspiring yeah when someone's really good I always want to write that that is the feeling I always Kaka go to work at it work but also I've cherished and held on to like a like a sacred Ember that I'm trying to keep keep alive my fan my my my love of being a fan of stand-up comedy  like I like watching it I'm a fan I love it a guy like going to see it like to this day like I'm working with my friend Joey Diaz tonight who I think is the funniest guy alive I'm happy I'm gonna go see comedy I'm going to see him like that I'd still like watching I still enjoy it I didn't for a while in the early days it was to I was too ambitious and I was judging myself versus them and if someone had a really great joke I wish I thought of it instead of enjoying  it I'll go God why didn't I think of that and that's a it's poison and then I realized luckily I got very lucky that I figure this out early on like you know couple two or three years and I was like I used to love comedy like why am I not loving common because I'm doing calm that's the dumbest fucking thing in the world the reason why I got into stand-up comedy was because I loved watching it now all the sudden I don't like it because I'm jealous or you know or a makes me compare myself to them and I don't like the feeling  or it makes me what is that that's so dumb and then I realized it thankfully and I had a shift and I caught myself yeah and I have managed to cherish and nurture that being a fan that feeling of being an actual fan the enjoyment of stand-up comedy I nurture that so that that to me is critical so when a guy like David tells on stage I can enjoy it I enjoy it I just can I can sit there like an audience member  for and just laugh but are you gonna smash question is when you sit in an audience of 17 you stinking aliens with watching Dave Attell okay are you experiencing him differently than the audience is because you are professional like him I'm sure somewhat but I try to shut down the analysis part of my brain as much as possible I try to shut down like why did he write it like that why doesn't he do it this way I try to just be a fan I try to just watch you know but I'm sure  I know some things are coming or I know the way I would do it or I know Dave very well so I know how he would do it I'm sure there's some sort of a difference between but that's like the same as immediate musician right if you're a musician if you're a guitarist and you watching an amazing guitarist even though they're really good you probably like okay I see what he's doing he's doing this thing like you understand technically like a turn I was my worried as I get older is that increasingly my reactions are simply versions of I would have done it  that's not how I would have done it right right as opposed to so if sake pumpkin comes to me for advice my first I think about oh that's here's the advice I'd like to give on this piece of writing my first someone actually was talking to a friend of mine yesterday brought to me an essay she's working on credibly interesting essay about the role of women in cinema and I give out so we're walking around and I'm telling her my response to it and  after I give it that I first thought was wait did I just say if I was doing it I was I would have done it this way and it was did I you know did I just simply impose my own standards and preferences on her which is not advice that's actually the that's the worst thing which you have to do is inhabit her mind and fix it according to her own intentions and yes I'll and I my I'm constantly paranoid about the notion that I am not  not being truly empathetic at the moment of giving advice I'm just projecting my own and I think that's that's something that happens when you get so when you become so sure of your own methods and professional personality that that's you know that's the kind of I wouldn't have done that when I was 25 because I didn't know what it meant to be to write a Malcolm Gladwell thing where I was just going to be acting as a human being but now I kind of have this thing  and in my skull yeah you have a method I have a method I'm going to try to mix it up but it's probably still riding everybody's method is Dipper ticket with writing right everybody's method is very different yeah everybody's voice is very different there's some key things with comedy one of them is as I said before the economy of words it's very important in comedy if you see the punchline coming too far out it loses impact with the more words you use but if you can get the punch line to the people before they see the punchline come  and that's a gigantic impact that's what my friend Joey Diaz does better than anybody he does he does it better than anybody he sneaks things in on you yeah yeah this reminds me of a long is very lines I've often thought this was the one of the greatest jokes like CIU probably those joke a lot in terms of economy this is the most economical great joke I've ever heard my life and it's from my God I forgot his name this is a polygon forgotten his name  Norm what you look like  he was he was in a lake Bell movie Lake Bell yeah he's an incredibly had his own show on it'll come to me the joke was you know those signs in bathrooms in restaurants you know all staff should wash their hands after using the bathroom right especially Earl  it's so embarrassing it's two words that transform the Ricky Gervais no no it's specially Earl especially so it's like I cannot go into a bathroom anymore without thinking of that joke it's so fantastic it's like you know you didn't like it takes this you know I don't need to explain the joke too it's just a mate two words have created this lasting image of Earl  it's subverted the whole bathroom thing it's I can't go to the bathroom and your head its burned into my head I was it Jamie it's I cannot believe I could I so humiliated I can't remember his name it was in New York kind of Indie comic okay but I just like that Rogue L know but we're getting close even close you know it'll come to me but he but that's like I'm I am amazed by the two words part mmm like it's just  that you can do it with two words just strikes me is the same reason why I'm obsessed I've always had an incredible love of television commercials really yes because the good ones the idea that you can communicate something emotionally powerful or funny or meaningful in 30 seconds is so badass like 30 seconds is nothing right and there are people whose job it is to communicate in some of the  not the run-of-the-mill like 80% of them are relatively straightforward they don't but there are there's a handful that are just magnificent there was one I mean there's a million examples of great ones but there was one really beautiful one  which was a Heineken Dad I've got no I've forgotten again the song they used were a bunch of kids jump in the back of a cab and they start singing a bell div Devoe song and the cab driver they're all young cool hipsters they're all crammed in the back and they're all like a little bit tipsy and the cab drivers this like crusty old school guy and it comes to the chorus and he  chimes in and it's just this moment it's 30 seconds and it's fantastic as you don't you're not expecting that you're thinking you see the Crusty old it's like a Boston cab driver right like some grizzled Irish guy who's like 70 years old and he's three and you think oh you must hate these kids because they're young and beautiful and their tips he has a Friday night and he's driving a cap and then the song comes on the radio and they all start singing along in their kind of drunken way and then he just joins in and this writer was right  it's fantastic and it's 30 seconds like somebody a really great and funny like the remember the Wendy's lady where's the beef oh yeah you'll never forget that one forget it three words where's the beef an image old lady screaming open it up a cheeseburger looking for the beef yeah like I mean how could you not how can you not take off your hat and person who came up with that yeah right if I gave you if you're if you're set with 30 seconds  squirt yeah let me really really hard right and you have to make a point you're trying to sell something yeah try yourself Jerry Seinfeld was going to open up an advertising agency for a while he had thoughts about I know he had done a couple of commercials and apparently he had written some of the commercials and he decided that he was going to write commercials yeah he was going to do that I think he's got so much Seinfeld money's like fuck that why am I working what am I doing I've got a billion dollars in the bank I just go back  more portions I mean his his he doesn't just have a billion dollars in the bank is more coming in coming in yeah it's like constantly coming yeah there's no it's like a yeah it just seems too big to does he did he get this Larry David have the same deal that he does I do not know I would love to know that first I would like to know that too I don't think he does and I would imagine he doesn't but I think he's probably extremely wealthy but he has in my opinion the most underrated sitcom of all time and Curb Your Enthusiasm there's times that I've watched that show  where I've been literally weeping laughing like holding my sides laughing yeah and it's so odd the way he does it you know do you know how he writes things yeah they have like a place where they like okay you're trying to sell me a toaster and Jamie's trying to stop me from buying that toaster but you're mad at Jamie and you're trying to be persuasive at me at the same time that's how they write so it's they just do multiple takes with really talented people and they find Magic  yeah it's Chris I mean it's crazy how open-ended it I've talked to different guys that have been on the show yeah about how they do it it's amazing that you have to love the amount of trust you have to have in your fellow actors yes yeah but it's kind of that's lovely yes particularly contrasted with this incredibly tightly controlled anal writing process that's in place in so many of those shows yes yes yes but it's also why that shows seem so organic yeah  no I mean there's talking over it sounds real it's like I had trouble watching it because it was too real to me I was just cringing with all of the social awkwardness he's just constructing one socially awkward situation after another right and I couldn't because I couldn't distinguish it from real life yes I just I just couldn't bear it much it was it was too much about it did you ever see the one where he has he's over the rapper's house krazee-eyez-killa is he though and the rapper has scar  bass player 24/7 I mean it's Larry David with this rapper it is fucking magic man it's magic it's so good the genius yeah well he's a legitimate genius there's no doubt about that and you know he's also like a real legit Oddball like you drives a Prius you know he is that schlubby guy is probably worth 500 million dollars or something crazy but you know he's not that kind of schlubby guy that's the way he he that's who he is yeah those  guys were in my right they were in New York like barely scraping by forever yeah yeah well he was a stand-up and he and Jerry knew each other from back then and you know he was a weird stand up like it's was an acquired taste it wasn't wasn't you know it wasn't yeah burned down comedy clubs who which Comics are not to your taste I'm not saying that you don't like I mean that are not to your taste that is whose humor just doesn't kind of  well no bunny I mean not that I can think of offhand I don't I wouldn't pay attention one of the things I've gotten really good at as I've gotten older is not paying any attention to things I don't like yeah just just letting it just slide right out of my brain and onto the floor and I'm not interested in it's just I spent so much time when I was younger and stupider worrying about things I don't like being upset if things had don't like well that sucks why do people like that what the fuck's wrong with them  and then realize like what a gigantic waste of resources that is in or just a huge waste of energy yeah that I don't care anymore you know as long as they're not stealing material as long as I'm not Vic make you know doing something terrible to other Comics victimizing as long as I'm not doing that I really don't care so when they're doing well good luck Zen yeah I try Jimmy and it's not it's not a mean it's not a hundred percent it's it's constantly a work of  yes but my philosophy is rooted in some sort of a pragmatic understanding of how my own brain works yeah like you don't you only have so much time and you only have so much energy and if you're wasting your time on things that you don't like that have nothing to do with you people like something like and that's how I feel about music and and movies and so many things there's so many things that I just don't like them at all but some people do I mean you know some people will that I think their music is done  shit but they'll have full Staple Center of people rocking out well I must be wrong it's not me it's not them it's just like everyone's different people have different tastes some people like really cheesy rom-coms they like it they really enjoy it they seek comfort in this movie where you know it's going to work out in the end it's going to it's not like in the end of fucking meteors going to land on the building and kill everybody and the the screen is going to Splatter  her with blood because you know their bodies explode you're not going to see that in this movie and this movie everything's going to work out great it's just like by that I have that feeling about Law and Order In fact what am I I've no idea why anyone would ever watch that show notes and one of my secret goals in life is at some point I would like to be appointed executive producer of Law and Order and I want to do ones that completely subverted franchise so we get you through your all everyone knows exactly how every one of those shows is always going to turn out right and I want to get to minute 47  and just go on some Savage you turn that just appalls and outrages absolutely and then I'll be done I'm just I'm quitting and I'm walking down to the black yeah about fuck and don't tell anybody that Malcolm gladwell's taken over no yeah it'd be totally honest I would push just gently push Dick Wolf aside let me have this one and we're going to like completely and we'll have it you know the the villain the will actually be one of the prosecutors that's what we'll do or something right along those lines and every episode ends like know  oh Country for Old Men style or the shit's over you like what the fuck exactly what but there's something there's a drug in those where they're comforting and that people know that the bad guys going to get caught in the good guy don't know this is a random thought but I don't know any men who watch them and I'm coming to the belief that they are there's something there actually for women and there are a very comforting kind of reassuring fantasy about how  how the world works that he that you know the system is so I had continued my this is incredibly complicated theory that I developed ones about these kinds of things so there's we all know what a western is yes a western is where is conceptually a world in which there is no Law and Order and a Man shows up and imposes personally Law and Order on the territory the community right so  there is also a Eastern what is an Eastern and Eastern is a place where by contrast is a story where they're like at the straight who's four types the Eastern is where there is Law and Order there are so there are institutions of justice but they are have been subverted by people from within so an Eastern would be the Serpico is an Eastern it's a crooked cop who is it's the bad  who has you know screwed up the there's lots of tons and tons of Hollywood movies are are Easterns the northern is the case where Law and Order exists and Law and Order is morally righteous system works Lon show Law & Order is a northern it's a functioning apparatus of Justice which reliably and accurately produces the right the correct result in confronting criminality every single  all day when it's on TV the southern is where the the entire way the southern is all John Grisham novels are Southern's they are where the entire apparatus is corrupt and where the reformer is not an Insider but an outsider so in in every John Grisham novel the same the opposite I love John Anderson has be clear but they are perceived from the same premise which is the system is rotten to the core and only this white knight who comes  from the outside can save us so in the western there is no system in the northern there's system it's fantastic in the in the Eastern the system is reformed from within but in the southern the system has to be reformed from without huh that's my complicated so I feel like anything you can place all art about Law and Order about criminal World criminal justice into one of these four categories and the so the  Brits love the northern so what is you know all of the famous British detective stories are always really becomes Sherlock Holmes yeah is it Northern it's like the system is like and you know there's no corruption in the police department they may be bumbling and Charles got to help them out but no one's you know off on some there's no there's never a case where there's a rotten cop who's selling out every  is there a modern version of the western because Westerns all seem to take place between the time of like fifteen sixteen hundred and eighteen eighty there is solely charge you read the Jack Reacher novels by Lee Child no but I watched one of the movies those are westerners those westerns there's you'll never the whole thing about a question is can you find the police can you find the police officer in a I I challenge you to find a police officer in a leech on  novel they're not nowhere to be found Reacher is a retired the hero is a retired army investigator he's not even in the Army anymore and it's just roaming around the country solving crimes on his own and he'll confront some massive criminal conspiracy and he never calls the cops right that's the whole premise that's so Western you can't call the cops in the classic Western because there's no cops to be found right here in Montana On the Border but reach her it's a it's a 21st century Western  turn so he doesn't call the cops because he doesn't feel like it it's just like they never appear like and he just murders everyone out on his own and then he gets on the train and goes to the next place they're amazing I love them so much do you write fiction no never I mean I I read so many Thrillers I read like I mean I'm probably read  how many do I hear 50 60 70 really I read you know when you go in the airport that's a lot into the Hudson News and you see all those there's a whole like wall of the strollers I have read every single one of that's means you're reading more than one a week yeah easy yeah wow that I read on top of that I read by serious stuff but I devour people send me Publishers send me these things in the mail just because I don't have to buy them anymore they just said they know that I'm obsessed likely  child's although he didn't with his most recent Lee Childs publisher for years you'd send me galleys the main I did cellular not recent happen I think they've forgotten me fucked up fucked up what are you consuming all of it reading or does it any of it book on tape now I'm reading at all yeah I mean I'm reading them in  Breakneck speed and I'm but I do there's a guy I'd love I love one of my favorites is Stephen Hunter who writes the you know they made some movies of his stuff Bob Lee Swagger these sniper movies they're fantastically well written and those the minute he comes out with a new one I read it the instant I mean I have to it's just like there's just such Delights and ever heard always so good really yeah so good hmm anything with the word sniper and it is generally one of his books and  shooter with Mark Wahlberg was one yeah and say that was a good guess but they're the books are fantastic I would recommend them wholeheartedly um how do you have the time to read all these books well that's my job not being Thrillers but my job is reading books literature yeah you know I read very quickly I suppose but I don't watch a lot of TV I just watch a little bit of sports don't really watch much so it is not a lot competing for my  attention but you know I know the book that I will read tonight at dinner so when you set out to write a book do you have a premise stewing in your head where it's just like throbbing we like that's it that's the one or do you halfway in I'll get it I'll start oh so you start a book with a little colonel they'll be a story I'm interested in I'll write it up and then I'll see where we're going to go from there like they'll be every one of my books began  a very very simple one chapter with the I didn't I didn't know what surrounded the chapter but there was something in the book in talking to strangers I got interested in these spy stories these that story of tell of of Ana Montes the Cuban Spy Who Rises to the top of the American intelligence establishment I began with that and I went and talked to the guy who caught her and he had such a fantastic interview with him and that just got me incredibly excited and that got me  this whole thing about here's a woman spying in plain sight for Castro at the top of the American intelligence establishment for 10 years no one catches her even though she's not some master spy she has the codes that she's using in her purse and the radio she's using in a shoebox in her closet like we're not talking about James Bond right and they she does it and no one even comes close to it they all like wow really really smart people and that was such a fascinating notion that even  in the most sophisticated and by definition paranoid agency in the American government they're spies I get away with old stuff like to think anybody ever gets away with it to retirement and then as never else oh absolutely in fact really so I go and I interview the guy who caught this woman Ana Montes and I'm leaving to go back to try back he's in a small town in Wisconsin and I you know as one does I turned off my tape recorder and put it in my bag and I'm walking back  to my car because I'll walk you to your car it's like okay and we're walking down the street and he begins to tell me another story even better than the one I went there to talk to him about which of course my typical is no longer running so don't have the story anymore what the fuck and the story was basically oh there's another bigger spy out there I now know I now realize there is this one thing out there right now well this was three years ago to there was one three years ago that's out there was actually just retired at the implication was they're still there they're bigger and I really was one of those  things where when he put together all the pieces to catch this one woman and a Montes he realized oh there's someone else and then he retired whoa he's like the implication was he couldn't get anyone else interested in finding the other bigger one but he knew there was someone out there but he didn't know the specifically who there were no he knew there was someone I forgot of course because it was his tragic thing where I tried off Mighty find him except back how didn't you just hold on stop stop stop let me put this back on do you think you would have told  you the story if your tape recorder was running don't think so fuck  it's kind of great it's a great he was incredibly after Siri comes in hey Siri record the Gladius right he was it's Chris but I think you know if you're in that world you just assume yeah they all assume they're Spies Like We have them we have them in there's so it's like they're not as maybe they're not as worked up about it as we are I don't know yeah there's there was a story recently where Iran assassinated some people that they  acted were CIA spies and I always wondered like how many people are spies and like you know Homeland style living in some other country assimilating into their culture getting jobs in organizations mm even in terrorist groups yeah infiltrating what a crazy way to live your life well there was a story I told him what a my podcast episodes Region's History season two I think that I ran across I love reading these memoirs  of like mid-level retard Intelligence Officers and tons of them and people only read them and I love there just because invariably like in the middle of the book The tell you some they'll just drop some crazy story and this guy that was the former general counsel to CIA wrote his Memoirs really interesting Memoirs in the middlee tells a story about how the CIA CIA a guy who was a really big deal terrorists in the 70s  and 80s really big deal has a change of heart and comes to the CIA and says I no longer believe in what I'm doing I'd like to work for you and proceeds to work for the CIA for some period of time unknown period of time and he's the he's way up high in Middle Eastern terrorist organization and that fact leaks to the New York Times and a reporter for the New York Times basically  rise a story outing him and the CIA frantically tries to get in touch with him to warn him and he vanishes they think he was killed fuck that reporter because they're it was a very interesting if you're reporting you have something like that though that's what the episode is all about because your whole job is to release information your whole job is to report on things so here you have this bombshell of a story that will make you look like a hero but it could get someone killed  what do you do fuck what I didn't realize is that there's a established pattern of people at the intelligence services and editors of newspapers talk all the time yeah about things like this like so they have Arrangements yeah they haven't put that in this case the arrangement didn't work

great books and he's got one now called talking to  jurors I love them and I really enjoyed talking to him and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did please welcome Malcolm Gladwell The Joe Rogan Experience trained by day Joe Rogan podcast by night all day  hello Malcolm Hey Joe how you doing I'm doing very well you sound like you good good that's always a good sign but it's through headphones it's very interesting because I've been listening to talking to strangers uh-huh I like that you narrate your books it's very frustrating with someone who's a great speaker does not narrate their books so thanks for doing that no actually I kind of enjoy I used to hate that process  with my first one and then I've grown to enjoy it because of you when you say your book out loud you see it in a different way like oh you know you get a little bit of a different perspective on it well I'm a giant fan of your work man particularly outliers I really loved that book very Illuminating and sort of peels away the the mystery of talent and so tell me what you're doing what is this talking to strangers I'm into about I'm in the  second chapter right now oh I see well that was that was a book about I was struck by how many of the kind of high-profile cases that we got obsessed with were at their root about the same thing which is the individuals were two people didn't know each other well had an exchange and they got each other wrong so you know everything from Amanda Knox to Bernie Madoff to the  to Larry Nasser at Michigan State to Jerry Sandusky at Penn State and then to the signature case which the book is organized around which is the Sandra Bland case member though young woman Texas it gets pulled over by the side of the road yeah they're all at rude fundamentally the same problem which is there's a there's an exchange between and exchanges goes wrong and the question is why that's what I began to get really fascinated by is you  this point in human evolution Evolution we have got this thing about talking to strangers down hmm and we clearly don't and we're being pushed to talk more and more to strangers right in a kind of globalized world and if we're bad at it that doesn't bode well does it well I think there's also an issue today with people not learning the necessary skills and how to talk to people because so much communication is done digitally yeah that's it  it seems to be a giant issue with young kids they're more Awkward initially talking to people than I think I remember yeah yeah yeah I think that's probably you forget how much I mean adolescent adolescents used to be this one one long rehearsal in how to be a normal human being right conversation and now the rehearsal it's like they were also got cut in half and you know instead of getting to the point where we play basketball  basketballs were still just doing Wind Sprints or so you know mmm right no it's actually playing a game and I'm playing the game I'm butchering the metaphor you I know what you're saying nothing the Sandra Bland case how does that one fit in because that one that that girl was pulled over the cop was 10 she was failure to signal right I mean it's a bullshit thing it's a bullshit thing and she started lighting a cigarette he told told her to put the cigarette out and it all escalated from there  that she said she doesn't have to put the cigarette out and then he says he's got a light her up he's screaming at her he pulls her out of the car he rests her and then is there controversy about whether or not she committed suicide in jail there he is I don't get into that okay because it seemed that seemed unlikely that she was killed that you as opposed to getting so yes it seemed likely that she was killed versus she committed suicide  I think that someone would commit suicide being in jail for 3 Days especially one of the things that you highlighted in the book and you actually played in the audio version of it her little sort of affirmations you know and she was she sounds very positive and upbeat and calling everybody kings and queens and it was everything thanking God and being very thankful and being aware of of life and humility and just graciousness and gratitude  it didn't seem I mean obviously you don't know and what kind of dark things can happen to a person when they're incarcerated for three days for a bullshit reason without maybe that's the straw that broke the camel's back but she did have you know she had a complicated emotional history she had previously I tried to commit suicide and she had she was emerging from quite a difficult period in her life and went to Texas to start anew  thief and so there is an interpretation like I said I don't really have strong feelings on this particular part of the story but there's an interpretation that says here's a woman who's emerged from very difficult period in her life goes leaves you she was in Illinois she drives half across the country to start over and on the first day that she arrives in Texas to start over she gets pulled over by a cop and by the way she had thousands of dollars in outstanding  tickets so she had a history of this bullshit stuff with cops where you know the the same trap that many poor people in this country get into which is they get the police use people as an ATM right they like set them off for a non trivial things and when they can't find when the campaign to find they get another fun and when you know you have that ghost she was part of in that trap so here she is trying to start over  difficult time gets first day she gets to Texas she gets pulled over again and she in her mind it's the same she's like oh my God I tried to start over and I can't yeah and then she's in jail and she can't make bail and you know there's a scenario where you can see that she just began to despair don't they take away your shoelaces and do Old Town Texas yeah are they doing things by the book and I mean I find the whole thing about I went to that town when I was reporting  book and you know the it's kind of hard to be to kill to kill someone and get away get away with it requires a level of expertise in four thought that struck me was not present in that little town in Texas I mean a certain time it's just not I don't they're not lat do not think in this is these are not people playing chess right I think they it's just encountered it with this  cop and he's not very good at his job and he gets way over his head and he completely missed reads her and he pulls her off to jail probably deeply regrets the whole incident and they're all embarrassed in sitting around and hoping it'll just all go away and meanwhile she's all alone in a prison cells spiraling deeper and deeper into depression I mean it's I think it's almost more tragic that she commits suicide she committed suicide it's insane that you can keep someone in jail  jail for three days for failure to Signal it seems like there should have been an initial review of the circumstances that led to her getting pulled out of the car in the first place and the cops should have been fired immediately they just look you're screaming at her because she lit a cigarette yeah in their own car we well this is fascinating and I feel like I don't know you and I are probably the same age there's this so the cops 29 if you grew up with cigarettes you have a different understanding of the meaning of lighting a cigarette  that so what's happening in the encounter is he pulls her over what he does is he sees her coming out of this University campus and while she still on campus property she rolls through a stop sign and then he notices that she's got out-of-state plates and she's a young black woman and she's driving a Hyundai like not a not a Mercedes Benz and he thinks ha I'm going to check this out so he she pulls onto the road and he drives up behind  and her aggressively he speeds up behind her so what does she do well what any of us would do she gets out of the way thinking oh he's a he's going to he's going to you know the scene of an accident or something I better get his way she pulls over to get out of his way and he goes oh you didn't use your turning signal and he pulls him up pulls her over and put him behind her and by the way whenever I hear a fire department truck or a police car coming and I pulled over to get out of the way I do not use my turning signal right you just get  the way it's reflexive right so her immediate thought is what he does is like oh this is bullshit and he tricked me and he knows what he's doing that's exactly what he wanted he wanted to get her in situation because it's all a pretext he just wants he think so maybe there's something weird with her so then here we have this all on tape of course because this is in this is one of the reasons I was captured entirely on the dash cam the officers dash cam it goes up to the window and he says  he looks at her and he realizes she's agitated why because I haven't she's pissed off and he was ma'am is there something wrong and she's like well you know I want to know why I'm below over boola and then he goes back to his car and he comes back to her and he later says in a deposition that when he goes back to his to his vehicle to check on her license and registration he begins to develop suspicions that she's up to no good she's got drugs or guns and so she comes back and they commenced to have this  increasingly heated conversation and she lights the cigarette because she's trying to calm herself down and this is my point you and I who grew up in an era where people smoked all the time no that one of the principal functions of lighting a cigarette was to calm your nerves and in her mind I think in her mind she's trying to signal to the cop let's deescalate this and I'm one of the ways I'm going to show you that I want to deescalate this is I'm going to take a moment  and I just cigarette and just take it down a notch and let's have a real conversation he doesn't understand the meaning of that gesture and he thinks oh she thinks several things he thinks one she's messing with me she's defying my authority by lighting a cigarette she's going to blow smoke in my face or something you know nefarious or she's gonna like take the lighted cigarette and put it out of my he has those kind of weird crazy fantasies this is what he said you  position oh yeah he so even on the level I try and identify in the book all of the different ways and this is when I come back to the case at the end of the book I go through this in more detail all the different ways in which he completely misunderstands her and one of them is he doesn't understand the meaning of lighting a cigarette in a moment of tension and that's you know still more evidence why you need if you're a cop or anyone dealing with a stranger you need to slow down and just not jump to any conclusions because  there's so much you can miss  what it seemed to me when I listened to it initially and then I listen to it again and your audio book there's a thing that happens with police officers and I've never been a police officer but I was a security guard for a brief period of time and I recognize it in myself and I recognized in a lot of people that I work with is that you start treating the other people like the other like it's us and them it was us the sky worked at great great Woods it's a performance center in Mansfield Massachusetts like this  and we would catch a lot of people smuggling booze in things like that and there was an attitude that you got and I was only there for one summer but there's an attitude of they were they were the bad people you were the good guys it was us and them and we stuck together and they weren't us and cops get that a hundred times worse because there's guns involved and they can get shot at we've all seen videos of  got cops pulling people over and he says can I see your hands please and guy pulls out a gun and shoots out them we've all seen those videos those are this is always in the back of the mind of cops yeah and I think that was just a guy who as you said 29 years old is a young guy he's not that bright not good at communication and he is this attitude that he's a cop and that you have to listen to the cops because he's them and you're you yeah and that that's like when he  telling her to put the cigarette out and she's saying I don't have to do that and he's saying get out of your vehicle and she's saying I don't have to do that and then he's screaming at her I mean that's that's all right there I mean it seems like to me he wants compliance he wants her to listen he does yeah he does what he gets it's funny the what's remarkable about that tape which I must have seen 50 times and which has been viewed on YouTube you know even a couple million times is how quickly it escalates yeah  no the whole thing is it's insanely short yeah you you would think if I was telling you the story of this you would think oh this unfolds over 10 minutes and it doesn't it unfolds over a minute and a half and that what I remember years ago I wrote my second book blink and I have in that book a chapter about a very famous Infamous police shooting in New York case of Amadou Diallo I remember that remember that when we shot like 40 times by cops  and one of the big things I was interested in talking about that case was how long does it take how long did it take for that hole  terrible sequence to go down so from the moment the police developed suspicions about Amadou Diallo to the moment that Amadou Diallo is lying dead on his front porch how long how much time elapsed and the answer is like two seconds it's bumbu is like and I had a conversation with actually here in the valley with Gavin de Becker has he ever been on your show no fascinating guy we were  three experts security expert incredibly interesting guys friends with Sam Harris I know that yes yeah and he was talking about this question of time that when you're a security guard guarding someone you know famous a lot of what you're trying to do is to inject time into the scenario instead of you don't want something to unfold in a second and a half where you have almost no time to react properly and what you want to do is to undo it to unfold in 5 seconds if you can add a  I'm making this up I can't remember his exact term but basically what your job is is to add seconds into the the encounter so that you have a chance to intelligently respond to what's going on and so he was hit this great riff about how good Israeli secret secure Secret Service guys are and one of the things they do is they're they're either not armed or they don't they're trained not to go for their weapons and  situations because it's point is so say you're guarding the president your body man but the president you walking through a crowd somebody comes up to you like pulls a gun wants to shoot the president it's point is if you're the secret security guy and your first instinct in response to someone pulling a gun is to go for your own gun you've lost a second and a half right your hands got to go down to your your whole focus is on getting to your own gun and in the meantime the other guy whose guns already out  has already shot you've lost you need to be someone who forgets about your own gun and just focuses on the on the man in front of you right and protecting the president but it was all in the context of time is is really crucial variable in these kinds of encounters and everything as a police officer you should be doing is slowing it down wait you know analyze what's happening and that's what he doesn't do the  in this instance speeds it up right he goes to Defcon you know she lights a cigarette and within seconds he screaming at her this is a you know a parent shouldn't do that I mean let a little police officer by the side of the highway right but the difference is he knows she's not a criminal  I mean he must know it's bullshit he's pulling her over because he's trying to write a ticket and the way he's communicating with her when she lights a cigarette it's like she's inferior like he this is not someone who's scared he's not scared of a perpetrators not scared that there's a criminal in the car about to shoot him he's not scared of that at all he wants utter total complete compliance and he's talking to her like like he's a Drill Sergeant the Kent  can't both those things be true  how so well in that so in the deposition he gives which I get to the end of the book and I got the tape of the deposition it's bad it's totally fascinating it's like he's sitting down with the investigating officer in the looking into the death of Sandra Bland and he's got I don't know how long it is two hours and he's walking them through what he was thinking that day and he makes the case that he was terrified that he was convinced he says he goes back to his squad car a boat  thumbs up and to submit through some evidence to support this so he pulls her over and he goes to the passenger side window and leans in and says ma'am you realize why I pulled you over blah blah and is he okay because he/she doesn't seem right to him she gives him her license he goes back to his squad car and he says while he's in the squad car he looks ahead and he sees her making what he calls furtive movements so he's like furtive movements also he thinks she's being all kind of Jumpy and you don't know  isn't he just says I saw her moving around in ways I didn't make me happy and then when he returns to the car he returns driver side which is crucial because if you're a cop you go driver side only if you think that you might be in danger right he doesn't if you go driver side you're exposing yourself to the road the only reason you do that is it when your driver side you can see the it's very very difficult if someone has a gun to shoot the police officer who's pulled them over if the police officer is on the driver side right you have an angle  on the passenger side so why does he go if he thinks she's harmless is no reason to go back driver side I think this guy I think these two things are linked I actually believe him he constructs this ridiculous fantasy about how she's dangerous but I think that's just what he was trained to do he's a paranoid cop and then why is he so insistent that she be compliant for the same reason because he's terrified is like do exactly what I say because I don't know what the what's going to happen here  right and she's you know I don't know I I don't think those two those two strains of of interpretation are mutually exclusive hmm that's interesting it didn't sound like he was scared at all it sounds like he was pissed that she wasn't listening to him yeah I didn't I didn't think he sounded even remotely scared I felt like he had I mean we're reading into it at right right I have no idea but from my interpretation was  he had decided that she wasn't listening to him and he was going to make her listen to him yeah that's what I got out of it I didn't get any fear and I thought that version of it that he described just sounds like horse shit it sounds like what you would say after the fact to strengthen your case well the so there's another element in here that I get into which is I got his record as a police officer it's a bit on the on the force for I forgot 9 10 months and we have a record of every traffic stop here  mermaid and when you look at his list of traffic stops Uris you realize that what happened that day with Sandra Bland was not an anomaly that he's one of those guys who pulls over everyone for bullshit reasons all day long so I think I've forgotten exact number but in the hour before he pulled over Sandra Bland he pulled over for people for other people for equally ridiculous reasons he's that cop and he's that cop because he's been trained that way right  kind of quotas strain strain of modern policing which says go beyond the ticket pull someone over if you if anything looks a little bit weird because you might find something else now if you look at his history as a cop he almost never found anything else his history is a copy in fact I went through those I forget how many hundreds of traffic stops he had in nine months if you go through them he has like once he found some marijuana on a kid and by the way the town in which he was working as a college town so I mean how hard is that  I think he found a gun once misdemeanor gun but everything else was like pulling over people for you know the the light above their license plate was out that that's the level of stuff he was using he did this all day long every day so he's like to him it's second nature yeah pull her over like who knows what's going on she's out of state she's young black woman was this comparable to the way the rest of the cops  force in his division did it well I looked at I didn't look at the rest of the cops on his voice what I looked at were State numbers to the wherever there are several American states give us like North Carolina for example will give us precise complete statistics on the number of traffic stops done by their police officers and the reasons for those stops so when you look at that so I have the I look at the North Carolina  numbers for example in the North Carolina Highway Patrol it's the same thing they're pulling over unbelievable numbers of people and finding nothing like night you know 1% less than 1% hit rates in some cases of being hit right being finding something of Interest so like the pulling over 99 people for no reason or to find one person who's got you know a bag of dope or something in the car you cannot conduct policing in in a civil society  Eddie like that and expect to have decent relationships between law enforcement and the civilian population yeah no question but doesn't that sort of support the idea that he's full of shit that he was really concerned that she had something he had never encountered anything well or or this was the one the fantasy and he's had his so what so the question is why does he keep doing it if this is got who day in day out pulls over people for no reason and finds nothing and continues to do it now there's two explanations one is he's totally cynical and thinks  this is the way to Be an Effective police officer exclamation number two is this is a guy who has a powerful fantasy in his head that one day I'm gonna hit the jackpot I'm gonna open the trunk and is going to be 15 pounds of heroin and I'm going to be the biggest star who ever lived I think there's also a rush of just being able to get people to pull over this the compliance thing which is another reason why he was so Furious that she wasn't listening to him yeah and she kept a cigarette lit yeah or she was listening but not complying yes yeah  what are the laws I mean are you allowed to smoke a cigarette in your car when a cop pulls you over how does it work like that yeah I mean of course yeah we can't stop you from a gauging they can't tell you to put out your cigarette there's no law that go he could have said mean no there's no law I mean by the Colorado two things the courts historically give enormously way to the police officers in a traffic stop as opposed to a person to person stopped but but  no I I mean this is about what he should have said is he could have said ma'am do you mind I would prefer if you put out the cigarette while we're talking or I'm allergic to smoke or whatever I mean he's a million ways to do it nicely he said yeah but he's he's a jackass about but he's I mean he's basically doing the job like a jackass he's doing a jackass version of being a cop well so this is so this is one of a really really crucial  in the argument of the book which is  I think the real lesson of that case is not that he's a bad cop he is in fact doing precisely as he is was in trained and instructed to do he's a he's the ideal cop and the problem is with the particular Philosophy of Law Enforcement that has emerged over the last 10 years in this country which has incentivized and encouraged police officers to engage in these incredibly low reward activities like pulling over  a hundred people are to find one person is because something wrong that is become enshrined in the strategy of many police forces around the country they tell them to do this I have a whole section of book right go through in detail of one of the most important police training manuals which is you know required reading for somebody coming up and which they just walk you through this like it is your job to pull over lots and lots and lots and lots of people even if you only find something in a small percentage of cases  why that's what being a proactive police officers all about right so they are trained at that phrase go beyond the ticket is a is a term of Art in police training like you got to be thinking you sure you pull them over for having a tail light that's out but your look you're thinking beyond that is there something else in the car that's problematic that's to try to find so there he was being a dutiful police officer in the the answer is to re-examine our  philosophies of law enforcement not to not I mean you can't dismiss this thing by saying oh that's just a particularly bad cop right that great but I don't know if he's any worse than you know he's just doing what he was trained to do that's the issue should be treated with him and efferent right that is the issue right the issue is there this is standard practice to treat citizens that are doing nothing wrong as if they're criminals yeah and pull them over and give them extreme paranoia and freak them out yeah I I find  I was home I'm Canadian and I was home in Canada small town Canada couple weeks ago and I saw in the back you know how these guys always have their often had a slogan on the side of the car the back of the car so in my little Hometown and Southwestern Ontario sleepy you know Farm country the the slogan on the back of the police cars is people helping people so Canadian right it is so clean it's awesome like the external understand this is a country  tree with very very low levels of gun ownership which means that a police officer does not enter into an encounter with a civilian with the same degree of fear or paranoia that the civilian has a handgun right which is a big part of this regardless of how one feels about gun laws in this country the fact that there are lots of guns mean makes the job of a police officer a lot harder and every police officer will tell you that in Canada the you don't have that fear but it's also Canada and its small town Canada and so when you encounter a police officer in  will Town his like he's people helping people he's like he's like driving like a Camry and he's you know he's like this genial person who's really camera means I forgotten exactly what they're dry they're not like they're not driving ex-coworkers yeah explorers painted black with like big bull bars at the front right and then you go you know I was you go I mean even in La you know I like the cars are painted black and white they them so they look for  ferocious I mean the whole thing is that what it is to look ferocious do I just look they identify as police to connait to a Canadian looks to me it looks a little why do they have to paint them black for that's nothing Oakland Raiders I mean it's like what do you think they should pay them something mild and like bright yellow something lovely something wobbly like a nice can you imagine like a teal or lime green well that would be yeah because there's a lot of black cars a lot of white cars on a lot of teal cars it's go  so it would stand out like oh it's cop is pink car but you know this kind of symbolism right matters right right you all expecting an image Sheriff Joe Arpaio who makes all of his prisoners wear pink yeah yeah that's kind of thing well I mean to against his point though how many women shoot cops isn't that an insanely low number yeah I mean insanely low I mean what are the numbers mean it's probably almost  an existent guys pull over women I don't think they're worried about being shot I really don't I think it's horseshit I think it's all after the fact yeah he was trying to concoct some sort of an excuse I'm going to excuse for is he still on the force I know here has either he's kicked off for I forgotten the precise language they use but for basically being impolite to a civilian but yeah I don't think there's a lot of I don't know  I mean I still think we're saying the same thing which is the thing that's driving him his motivation is not rational right and if you were a rational actor you would never engage in an activity where 99.9% of your police stops resulted in nothing burn your he's he is often some weird kind of fantasy land for a reason which is that's what in certain jurisdictions in this country that's what law enforcement has come to look at look like  that's that's problematic it's a huge problem yeah the Power Trip aspect of it I mean you know I've often said what would they do you know because there are certain out there certain areas where police officers do have quotas or they have to write a certain amount of tickets what will they do if no one broke the law for six months welcome to the show that's what small town Canada yeah it's right it's not what would they do I mean I really be curious like what would happen to the numbers like because you boy  you're saying that these people is an ATM there really do mean people are their glorified Revenue collectors they're pulling people over trying to write huge tickets and I believe is North Carolina where you're talking about that's got this creepy law that they've recently I think they've recently changed it where you're allowed to just confiscate people's money because if you see like I pull you over hey Malcolm why do you have three thousand dollars on you yeah you have $3,000 in cash what are you doing with $3,000 Kimmy  that money and they take it and you have to prove that you weren't going to buy heroin or by illegal guns or whatever and then most of that money wound up going to the police department yeah so they used it to like build a fucking gym for the cops or whatever I mean he's literally they had an incentive to keep the money and is that North Carolina that they did that there's a number of states that have Carolina that have this confiscation civil four people lost yeah and they're really gross do they still have that orders  I mean I know it's check extremely controversial and people are up in arms and Furious that you know their money has been stolen people on the way to buy a car for instance you know and they get pulled over in the Kabul just take all the money this is what I talked a little bit about the Ferguson case in my book later on tonight this is what Ferguson was ultimately about the focus in the Ferguson case was whether the officer in that case is Darren Wilson what he did and didn't do to Michael Brown but the real  story when the barber just has investigated the real story is not being kind of chinos to it is that that that the police department in Ferguson was being run as a revenue-generating arm of the city government and people in city government were directing the activities of law enforcement to maximize revenue and at this is incredible stories of there's one story where there's a guy who's just been playing basketball and he's sitting in his car  parked by the basketball court like cooling off after play basketball cop roles in pulls up behind him and ends up writing eight tickets including accuses the guy being a pedophile gets him for one of these you get some is putting a false name on his driver's license when his driver's license his real name was like Michael and his driver's license had Mike like that's the level of eight tickets right that was routine practices  and so you you know you there's a reason why a kid like Michael Brown in Ferguson is gets really angry at law enforcement because law enforcement was a completely discredited institution in that City for years and years and years and years and years they had been basically praying they had been praying on the on the low-income community of that town so of course relationships between the population and the cops had reached a low ebb that's a real  you know there's a it's funny the one of the reasons I wanted to write this book was then the kind of conversations we have around these things Frozen is a great example 95% of the conversation about Ferguson was just about trying to break down what happened between a cop and Michael Brown and the issue when we finally look at it in a systematic manner we realize oh no it's not about that it is about a system that had been in place for years and years and years and years when which the the the African-American population that  town had been preyed upon by the police department that is the broader and you cannot come to an understanding of what happened with Michael Brown until you willing to engage that case on that much more broader systemic level  when you make the title of this book talking to strangers are you do you have a goal that you're trying to achieve are you trying to illuminate certain aspect of communication you trying to highlight issues that people have had with these stories like the Michael Brown story or yeah I mean I'm trying to  I wanted to start with the premise of why are we so bad at you know like I tell the story in the book of the Larry Nasser Case of Michigan State which ones are that's the guy remember the doctor for the gymnastics team oh yeah turns out to have been sexually molested file yeah you Jennifer so there you have a case where everyone thinks they know this guy he's their friend he's this gifted doctor the parents are willingly bringing their kids to to be treated by him the parents are in  room while he is abusing their kids and they don't see it the kids are saying something weird happened in the parents are dismissing it so I wanted to that's a good example of a phenomenon that I wanted to try and explain which is how is that possible how can we think we know someone and be so completely wrong how can you take your kid to a doctor and think the doctor is the greatest possible doctor and he in fact what he's doing is abusing you  your child in front of you right and that's a very similar kind of problem to Bernie Madoff people invested their life savings with this guy not not little old ladies in Dubuque sophisticated Savvy incredibly intelligent investors handed over millions of dollars to this guy who was not even true I mean the Madoff fraud was so outrageous he didn't even bother to him  he didn't even put it in t-bills I mean he just spent it it was just like crazy what's T bills treasury bills oh I mean he wasn't even he was he was 100% sociopath fraud yes and people over the course of 20 years wrote check after check after check after check to him thinking was This brilliant investor you know it's like that's a puzzle that's what I want to get it like people did recognize as something was wrong  wrong right you're the were financial analyst that were saying that this doesn't make sense a few of them but it's funny there's a my favorite story on the in the Madoff chapter is the greatest hedge fund in the world is Renaissance Technologies these are the guys out in Long Island who have had like 30 percent returns for 25 years they're like all PhD are you know AI genius literally Geniuses and they found themselves  his before bit off was busted they found themselves with I think 30 million dollars in a Madoff fund because of some complicated transaction and they're all Geniuses so they look at what made us doing it again and I don't look good like that doesn't make any sense to me and so like what should we do we have 30 million dollar stake in a fund and we don't understand what the guys doing and you would think logically they would sell their stake they don't because it's returning know it did in fact it's not even returning that their own legit returns are twice  is his illegitimate returns they're making they actually make the point that his returns it really low for us like there's no reason for us to keep their money but they don't sell what and so that's what I was trying to stand like they can't even you know there's this notion I'm talking about is called default to truth which is this idea from a researcher called Tim Lovin which is as human beings we are trusting engines we are evolved to give people the benefit of the doubt and once you understand that and why do we do that because it's the right move 99%  percent of the time most people are being truthful and if you have is your strategy I'm going to believe what people say it makes you fantastic friend a wonderful person to work with it means that you can you know skate through the world with a minimum of fuss if you're the parent like person is a person whose life is a nightmare right because they are suspicious of everything that moves so we evolved  to be trusting engines because that makes your life easier but the best part of human people want to mate with you like if you want to talk an evolution in terms about who passes on their genes nice people pass on their genes it given the choice between having a child with a crazy suspicious paranoid person or a loving trusting person you choose a loving trusting person a hundred percent of the time so multiply that out times a million years of human history you realize trusting genes beat  no jeans every day of the week right so that's what we are what credulous by by by evolutionary choice so those guys at in the Renaissance there are no different they may be smarter than the rest of us but they're not constructed differently their inclination is to believe people and like well I don't know guy says he's a good investor me why not let's hang on to it see what happens right that's their motive they don't they don't you don't get to run a organization as  cessful as Renaissance Technologies if you're some crazy paranoid person right how would you even invest in anything if you were crazy and paranoid there was a lot of people that were really intelligent than invested in Bernie madoffs hedge fund to Steven Spielberg was one of them you lost it shit ton of money oh yeah I mean look at the roster list there isn't a you cannot point to an unsophisticated investor on the list of people who lost the most money from the every one of them was smart that's strange it's so great it's great like think about like and by the way  getting a decent return in the market is super easy you you go to Beto Vanguard and they you know they'll give you the market return your in your ass on that hard but these people like they wanted to do something fancier and they and that's what happened well he when you realized what a sociopath he actually was is in the interviews after he's caught or he's demanding certain things and complaining about certain things he doesn't seem to have any remorse no no he wants better  treatment he wants better food he doesn't seem to have any remorse that he's you know literally robbed people their retirement yeah ruined the last part of their lives where they thought they were going to have a considerable sum of money to sit back and just enjoy their grandchildren know now they're broke now they're poor yeah and now they have to figure out a way to get by and eat he doesn't give a shit he did he doesn't in fact what's weird there's so many things weird about the Madoff case one of them is we forget  it he doesn't get caught he turns himself in right and he turns himself in because not because he's screwing up because he's quote unquote so good because remember the financial crisis hit in 2008 and his clients are losing so much money on their legit Investments that they go to man up and say can I have some of my money back from you I got to pay off all the stuff I've done that it's gone sour so like in effect no one ever caught him he get  get caught by a once-in-a you know one-in-a-million circumstance where he's the only one making any money for his clients so they come after him my point is if you if you're totally rational and you look at this you say here's a guy who managed to bamboozle the most sophisticated people in the world to the tune of billions of dollars for 25 years he only gets caught because we had a once in a lifetime Financial meltdown isn't the rational lesson of that that we should all be Bernie madoffs  Ray is like super easy it's like not that hard I could all I have to do is you know he dressed really nicely I get really nice office space on the east side of Manhattan whatwhat did he actually do nothing really didn't invest in anything you just moved to other people's money around and he ran a Ponzi scheme he spent a lot of it and how does son's not catch on to this it's good question because they're not being but one of them committed suicide right that's right and  so it's an open question of how much they do how much anyone else knew I you know the older I get the more I believe in the powers of particularly within within family denial is something now I don't find hard to believe hmm so your ability I've now heard so many stories of you know a parent is some kind of monster and family members just won't see it  it just can't bring themselves to go that so did they know something everyone knew there was something slightly fishy and what Bernie was doing but they never went so far as to think that he was just making it up so they knew something was up but they didn't know it was a hundred percent horseshit they thought that he was so there were some people thought that he actually had Investments but he was there was a suspicion for example he was front-running that because he had a larger business  sort of managing the deal flow in the NASDAQ that he would get Advanced word of where money was flowing and he would jump ahead of the queue by stocks before other people did and profit off the when the stock would rise he would just sell in profit of that difference so there was a feeling that he had a dubious kind of illegitimate strategy that nonetheless legitimately made him a lot of money so people like well if so long as he can get away with it and I can profit off it I'm fine  but the truth is he wasn't doing that at all into this he was just he was he had his he had some Confederate in the Attic of his company essentially making up trade orders from scratch I mean they were just making shit up did how many people got arrested I forget I think they took I can't remember the exact number I think they got he had two Confederates I think he went down with him that's it I think it's what it was he in retrospect it's a really it's one of these crazy it's one of these  you think you know that whole institutions would have fallen yes no this did you ever hear the conversation that he had I believe it was recorded somehow on a phone or something or maybe it was after he was in jail where he's talking about trying to get money back from one of his biggest investors the guy had gotten like a billion dollars from him over the years that's right yeah right yeah he's like you got to give the money back he's like fuck you I'm not giving you shit yeah and you know then this  this crazy conversation where he's basically telling this guy look you knew this was bullshit and you are making money off this and now you know yeah yeah so so this is like the clever so you think about this that guy I know she's actually talking about yeah so it's a game thus to let's just do a let's do a a a hypothetical scenario okay you have a friend who's an incredible salesman and is gone around Europe and Saudi Arabia and raised  in our fund 20 billion dollar fund and they're promising a 20% return a year on your investment right so you give them a million you're getting two hundred thousand dollars a year back from this thing you know it's all bullshit but no one else does what is the rational thing for you to do the rational thing for you to do is to take your onion million dollar investment is to take the two hundred thousand dollars that is made made in quotation marks every year out of the fund so you say most people you know when you invest in  in stocks and only what you do is you check the box I want my I want any dividends or earnings reinvested in the fund don't check the box take the real cash so if you're investing with this phony friend of yours for 20 years you're going to get two hundred thousand dollars a year for 20 years that's four million dollars you will make four million clear of your out of your 1 million initial investment in in 20 years right that's  art if you know what's going on so that's what some people did with Madoff they're like yeah I don't know what he's doing these returns are pretty fantastic I'm just going to take all my earnings off the table every single year so they are the ones who the real winners of this whole thing with those people because this money is not real that money's coming from other investors is the things being made actually what happens with them like if a guy does make all these millions of dollars like that one guy he had to so give some of it back  yes it when happens is they appoint remember they appoint a after the Scandal breaks and been made up is invested they bring in a kind of supervisor potential supervisor who has the power to clawback winnings from money from the people who took who took cash off the table so but not everyone had to claw back in the question was how far back do we go so if you were investing if you were invested with Madoff 25 years ago and you took  you know 10 million off the table between 1990 and 1993 do you have to give that up too like it gets complicated also how can you prove that he was doing the same activity back that actually exactly oh it's a conversation I really wish I could remember where I was hearing this conversation but somebody had recorded Madoff talking to this guy tell them look you gotta give that money back yeah yeah yeah my schwab fun looks better and better all the time it's just so scary to me  that mean finances in the stock market and all that stuff is always looked like magic like what is going on there what are they doing they're moving these numbers around like when you see the ticker tape Roll by like what what is all that if you don't have any understanding of it it's like a foreign language yeah and so you're hoping that all these Geniuses can't be duped all these people throwing their tickets up in the air and everybody this is really goodbye cell they all know what's going on you don't know what's going on but hey there's a lot of things that you know that they don't know and this is just how the world works yeah turns out no turns out the people  people that were involved in this crazy very difficult to understand thing didn't know it either like they barely can understand it and this guy was just stealing money in some weird way and if the stock market didn't crash if we didn't have some sort of a depression who knows how he might still be in operation today he would soak without without the crash of 2008 there's a very very strong possibility that pretty Madoff would still be going gangbusters all he has to do  keep surviving is to take in enough money to cover withdrawals yes so there's some like we said there's a some portion of people who withdrawing their winnings he just needs to make enough to get new enough new money to cover their withdrawal so he's got a fifty billion dollar hedge fund and let's imagine there's a billion and withdrawals coming out every year he's got a raise a billion now if you're burning you already have 50 something hard to raise another  and particularly because he had people all around the world and he was giving them the huge fees to raise money for him so that's the other way that the root of the people who really made money from him were the people who had I forgotten what it was but you would be say you're you're you're Joe the financial guy in Zurich you have a whole bunch of wealthy European clients Bernie would let for every for every million you raised for Bernie Bernie would let you keep I forgot what it was a hundred  and I mean it's a nice base that's real money yeah she just kick back 902 Bernie and keep a hundred grand and that your favorite free and clear no one's climb that back right that's those guys got very very very well very very wealthy that's weird money is sitting in your house that stealing built God that's got to be strange so what can be learned in terms of communication from The Bernie Madoff story well the boot  he made up story and the  all in all of these ways but this one in particular goes to this question of we really think we're good at spotting liars and we're not so virtually every profession that is invested in you know in an investigation of human beings has some belief that you know we know how to figure out is like yes and the truth is nobody does and if someone tells you they are good at spotting Liars there's a 99% chance that they're lying so that the evidence  the see if you could think if we did an experiment here where I had a hundred people parade through this office right now the studio right now and every one of them made a statement in front of you and some wood long as someone tell the truth and I asked you Joe tell me who's lying who's not yours accuracy rate your success rate would be 52 to 54 percent other words slightly better than chance you might as well flip a coin it's not me but if you don't and that's  about you anyone in that chair watching these people parade in front of us is going to do a slightly bit better than chance and the reason was that he better than chance is there are small fraction of people who are such epically bad Liars that there's just we're not going to lose those people like week those are obvious one thing that you can tell those if it's an area of your own personal expertise right like if someone tried to talk to you about what it takes to write a book and get a book published and get a book on the New York Times bestseller list  and they were just making things up you would you would okay so that so this is oh so now you're talking about separate thinking specialist That's content-based So if I pretend to be a UFC fighter you're going to spot my liar my lies in 5 minutes because you know more about the content than I do but let's remove but there you're not catching me because I look like I'm lying you're catching me because I'm saying something that's bullshit I have a good story about that I really have a good start I used to think that I was really good at spotting Liars  and then I met this guy I met him through a friend and that's I'd given myself a pass and then I met him through this friend he was a friend of a friend so I just assumed he was okay because my friend is very good friend and this guy was claiming to be this Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt and he was writing for this online magazine that was like a well-read magazine in the martial arts world and it was the Abu Dhabi combat club they're responsible for this big the Abu Dhabi  submission World Championships is the biggest championships in the world is very highly regarded High Prestige this guy was talking about these fights that he had had and you know people bullshit a little bit so you give people a little bit of room for that but then he was talking about this particular particular move that he had pulled off in a fight that he had just learned from my friend and it's a very difficult move to called The Twister it's basically a guillotine from wrestling  and set up from position called side control it's really complicated you have to wrap someone's leg around you have to roll onto your left shoulder you have to get behind them they have to grab their arm put it over your shoulder grab ahold of their spine and it's essentially like a spine locked a very difficult move to pull off and it takes a long time to master the steps it takes a long time to understand the position so this guy learned it and then a couple days later claimed to have pulled it off in Thailand  and it was like it's like one of those scenes in a movie with a record scratches and everybody just goes what and I remember we were like what's going on so then my friend winds up rolling with him rolling his sparring it's you do Jiu Jitsu rolling and he comes back to me and goes there's no fucking way that guy's black belt it doesn't even make sense he goes he's like he doesn't know what the fuck he's doing like this is really weird so he winds up having this conversation  National conversation with them on the phone while I'm in the car is talking to him and he goes I want to know what you are because you're not a fucking black ball so tell me what's going on it says he no no my black belt in Japanese Jiu-Jitsu it's different it's not time goes out what he tells got to go fuck himself time goes on the guy winds up killing someone he winds up murdering this girl that he's having sex with murdering her husband and he gets caught driving around hurt his car  the guys car after he's killed the guy and then he winds up trying to recruit a friend to kill someone it's like this whole big thing and he winds up going to jail and he's in jail now but I remember thinking okay you don't know shit about catching and spotting Liars because you didn't you didn't spot that guy's being completely full of shit like I thought it was a little full of shit but I didn't know he was a like a complete sociopath and a murderer yeah so this is an interesting question  using that scenario would you have done a better job if all I gave you was the transcript of this guy speech so there's this is a there's a lot of interest in this question the community people who study deception so there's many different I can suppose I'm trying to improve my ability to spot lies I can we can do three things I can listen to you face-to-face as you're telling me something as either true or false I can we  this entirely on the telephone so I don't see you I just hear you or I can just read the transcript of what you say and try to decide whether it's true or false and it seems to be the case that we're better when we just when we remove Sight and Sound and all we have are this the word to plain words on the page there was the nurse what being present does is it introduces all kinds of  of noisy information that just distracts us from the core question of whether the truth is being told so maybe it was maybe if all you had was a transcript and as this guy is describing this particular what was the name of the movie Twister the Twister maybe as you're looking at the way he described and all you're doing is focusing on the precise way in which he describes this very very intricate move and you would realize oh he actually doesn't understand what he's talking about and you would have seen it clearly in that moment if you but maybe there was something  this presentation that threw you off the scent it was the move itself it see because if he just said oh I got it I got the guy in an armbar well a lot of people catch people in our bars it's a very common move you learn it first day of Jiu-Jitsu yeah you can catch someone someone makes a mistake in your white belt and they reach up and you grab their arm you can catch an armbar yeah Twisters very difficult to pull off very difficult yeah it's only been done in the UFC  maybe once I think Chan sung Jung the Korean zombie pulled it off once he may be the only guy maybe one other guy ever yeah sky was delusional that ever so it was it was horseshit and the only thing that we were taking into consideration like he was fight supposedly fighting in Thailand which turns out there was no fight at all he's a complete liar yeah the only thing that we were taken into consideration was maybe this guy fought a scrub like he could have fought someone who really didn't know anything and he said let me try the Twister on them  but then that's like you have to be beating the guy so badly you just would end the fight you wouldn't do a twister on him the only time you do a twister as if you're a highly skilled Grappler and you think you could put someone into position that they don't understand because it's a confusing position it's a position that there's a common position called back Mount where you would choke someone or you would transition to other moons from there and he was almost there but not quite there because you're caught you're kind of on the side so even season Grapplers  really make mistakes and get caught in the Twister but you have to be a fucking wizard to pull that off on somebody yeah it's not something you have to be really good it's not something that you can just do so when he said he did it we were all like what it wasn't if he said he had kicked the guy knocked him out oh that well that happens all the time yes he punched a guy hit him with an elbow and cut them the referee stopped the fight all that stuff is real that happens all the time he chose this one signature move of my friend Eddie  and we were both like there's something wrong here man yeah something wrong here there's a hilarious version of the sun I'm a runner and I'm on all the running message boards as one called let's run which is system and they're constantly catching people who lie about their Marathon times it's hot it's a hilarious that well there's all kinds of reasons but a lot of it is it starts with the eyeball test so they'll be a you know because a lot of marathons have to take pictures of the participants at various points during the race and some will claim to run like  a 240 Marathon now 240 you did really good run it's not world-class learning beside very good to be serious to rent your foot so they'll eyeball someone who claims to run 242 say now I mean he's just looking at them 10:00 10:15 extra pounds right there they should be they should look like they've been running a little bit look totally fresh as a daisy right now they're what are they doing wearing those shoes no 240 marathon is like is that kind of processed and then because the second order where they do complicated  it analysis of splits and they do all this kind of thing but it often begins with the same thing it's like you just guys trying to claim to be this and say yeah no no that's right that's not working that's like a I love those Insider e well I have this thought about how much culture has shifted through the internet and how much cultural shift again in the even more astronomical way once we can read minds and I don't think we're far away from that I think we're a few decades away from some technology that allows  as people to establish intent and to see thoughts and I think they're very there's some sort of theoretical work they're doing on this right now and there's there's different models that they're trying to achieve I think that's going to eliminate a lot of the bullshit of communication and I think it's going to happen really quickly just like Google sort of eliminates a lot of the bullshit of people telling stories about something at some of those what what  wait a minute what year and they go good that didn't happen and they can find out like almost instantaneously I think we're going to be able to figure that out with people I think there's going to be a way where you can where we can see intent and we can read minds I don't think we're far away from that yeah I mean I know this neural link thing with Elon Musk is very elon's very hush-hush about this is different sort of electronic brain interfaces that they're trying to  experiment with yeah I wouldn't wouldn't you worry be that if we read were able to read someone's thoughts mmm intentions what we would in fact discover is even more confusing than what we know now in other words maybe what's inside my head right now are 35 different thoughts and intentions warring at with each other murder scenarios yes mercenary then Malcolm just sort of keeps everything everything I'm Thomas surface supernormal  I think it's totally true think about it most of us there's any number of things think about that yeah the list of the list of possible things that could come out of my mouth at this very moment is infinite right it is infinite there are at this very moment God knows how many scenarios swirling around my head about what should I say next right and why is my intention to try and make you laugh to impress you to piss you off to disagree with you II agree with you I mean if we can  go on and on and on all those are in play so you really want to look inside my head and get you're not going to get clarity he's going to be a mess or we're going to realize we're all a mess yes like it would make us feel a little bit better like oh everybody's out of their fucking mind but would you want that yes you would yes I'm endlessly curious about I know my mind is such a mess there's so much chaos going on there I want to know what's going on other people's I want to know how fucked up am I alright  my normal is it so standard here's my fear I've many fears about this kind of thing but my fear would be as follows that I cannot count the number of times when I have had reactions to things that people have said in the moment that turn out to be wrong deeply in badly wrong and one of the things that I have learned as an adult is too deeply distressed those kinds of reactions and to wait and very often what will happen in my case sometimes the waiting takes a long time  I'm the kind of person who sometimes a month will pass and I will think back on a situation and I'll think oh my God I totally misunderstood that this person who I thought was a jackass is actually someone you know a lovely person who I should give a second chance to or whatever that comment that someone made that I thought was stupid is in fact extremely thoughtful and insightful this will happen weeks months later whatever if you were able to read my  mind in the moment you would judge me for my mistake and not give me an easy way to correct it and it was you trap me in like what if this would have had a reaction to something you said in this conversation which I've said Jesus can't believe that that's dumb and then I'm driving back to LA tonight and I think oh actually oh that's really interesting and thought about the time I don't want you to short-circuit my learning process about you I want I want to give me the  of my my six hours of thinking about what you said and allow me give me that kind of time to come to a reason that insightful conclusion about how I feel that's interesting but we're talking then about only one person having the technology because if you both have the technology and there wouldn't be any issue you wouldn't be confusion as to why someone was saying something you'd be--you'd you have a much clearer path to understanding their thought process and their intent behind it really  yes get a mean if one person has it right then yeah I get it yeah if I can read your mind oh I said something and Malcolm thinks I'm a retard like you know there's that but there's another there's another possibility that both people have it and this is also one of the things that would be fascinating about this is one of the things about forbidden words is forbidden words carry with them intent they have automatic intent right but you can say  the exact same word and have different intent behind it if we could understand clearly what your intent is then taboo words would automatically become meaningless it wouldn't mean it's not about sound you make it's not about forbidden sounds always what it's about is thoughts yeah and what you're trying to convey and what's happening to you as a human being who are you like what what what is your process for the way you communicate what is your process for the way  you're trying to develop these thoughts in your mind and express them to people well well part of the problem with that is language right and part of the problem with making certain aspects of our language forbidden is you limit people's ability to colorfully communicate and express themselves in certain ways I think that alone just eliminating that alone eliminated in confusion and also highlighting you know you could highlight real  homes with people's thoughts in the way people communicate but also eliminate many problems so you'd say oh he doesn't mean that like you could see what he means like this is what this is where his mind is you could see you could literally see the thoughts yeah yeah I guess I would also let me let me get let me throw another complicating Factor it still leaves the question of cultural context yes of course one of the things I got really interested when I was writing my book was how our kind of cultural frames of  reference profoundly complicate our attempts to understand other people and so in your scenario where I have some kind of window into your thinking and intention I still need to know in order to make sense to you I still need to have a very clear idea of the cultural kind of rules of the road that you're using and they're likely to be different from mine and or particularly if you know I mean I'm a Canadian you're not but imagine if the  between us was more profound if rise you know then you still like like I was is a really cool thing I've been obsessed with with memory I'm doing things I'm memory in my in revision history this coming season and I was reading about this really fascinating experiment which is done with Korean and American college students adults essentially and what I do is I give you three circles  paper circles and one is past when its present when his future and I say those are three concepts represent those three concepts with these three circles so the American kid has passed here present in the middle future over on the right three independent circles the green kid puts all piles all three circles on top of each other  now what does that mean I don't know what that means it means something interesting right it means that they don't they're not separating these three modes the way that we are there certainly coming at experience with a very different set of assumptions so maybe so I think of the Civil War is a long time ago but if I'm Korean maybe the Civil War is as present in My Kind Of Consciousness is something that happened last week is that maybe that's not what that means I'm not exactly sure I'm sort of guessing  because I don't know the I haven't fully investigated but the point is there are I've just given you one random example there are a great way incredibly different rules that different cultures use to organize experience so if I'm looking at  you and reading your thoughts I have to know those rules because those rules are sorting out how people so this is only this is not I'm not to I'm not dissing this notion of that you're talking about I'm saying that it needs to have another layer as well a cultural Earl a cultural are which kind of alerts me to how you're organizing experience not certainly makes sense it's it's interesting when you think about like the Tower of Babel write like this this idea that one  in time everyone spoke the same language and God sort of set it up so that it was we're never going to be able to really communicate with each other because everybody has a bunch of different languages and we'll never figure it out that was that's the sort of crunched up version of it if there was a way to change the way like all languages are essentially little symbols that are written down on paper or typed out and then sounds you make with your mouth and they convey intent  if there was a way to do another version of language a universal version of language that's eventually adopted but I'm reading this book about these people that were kidnapped by Native Americans and they were assimilated into the tribes they learn the language and is happen over a course of a couple of years and I was thinking like what would that be like if you you know that's how you learn a language or kidnapped by you know what I mean yeah like you got but if there was a new language  how long would it take for adults to learn a new language if someone came up with a new language of completely Universal characters and this language is conveyed through this technology rather than through your mouth so it's your your your thoughts your thoughts interface with some sort of Technology it creates whatever hieroglyphs some sort of visual language that we all agree upon and then this is universal this is you  Universal throughout all cultures yeah and the only thing that we'd be confused about assumptions and rules as far as like what's okay well you could do that can't you can't we kind of do that already in a sense that we could have a universal language and then we have a device you know sitting on our phone or something yeah that when we I'm in you know I'm in some for I'm in Bulgaria and I'm ordering coffee I speak into the device and it simply translates either translates  directly in the Bulgarian that's actually not that hard no or it translates this into this common language that the Bulgarian translator services and if you think of the technology at a slightly more advanced level than it is now it could be done in a very seamless way like it doesn't have to be some bulky box it could literally be that I am speaking in English and what you're hearing is there's a filter and what you're what you're hearing is this other language I mean  well don't don't Google buds or whatever they are there they are you know they are pod version of those Google things I think there's something some technology that actually enables you to instantaneously translate that yeah there's some doing for you yeah I know you hate for Google to have one more thing over us right it's like not enough that they should control 9/10 of our life yeah well so going to let them control our communication I remember as a kid we days to love Doonesbury did you reduce yes  is a hilarious thing and Doonesbury where I forgot who uncle duke or somebody is going to China and his uncle Duke Hunter has Thompson yeah he was and he was appointed Ambassador I think he was imported American ambassador to China and its and that was a joke and he would go and he would meet with like the head of the president China and he would say the most incredibly incendiary outrageous things and the translated never translated what he said would turn he would say this rageous offensive thing and the translator is saying you know  the flowers are blooming today I just thought I was hilarious yeah Jamie had a thought once that hieroglyphs 420 2019 are essentially emojis oh yeah it's kind of  I mean what's your sort of was saying yeah like the internet you have to translate English into bits in order for the computer to translate it into an emoji it's almost I feel like that's almost what you're saying although it's not exactly it's a Bing is a beginning step yeah it's exam 1 2 yeah it just seems like this is not the best we can do North noises with your mouth and then you know learning English is incredibly complicated for someone who speaks Mandarin and vice verse yeah you know it's all very  very what if we all said hey look this is some new version of a language like whenever there's a whether it's contact or whenever the some movie about extraterrestrials though is a team of scientists and linguists and Geniuses to get together and they go look we're going to establish a universal language they communicate with these people and Close Encounters of the Third Kind it was music du du du didn't do that they would figure out some way we're going to figure out a way to talk if we  had some enormous Financial incentive or some enormous crisis was in playing we had to all communicate with the same language and so remember when they were trying to push the while you're from Canada the metric system was actually real over there was very little that was in high school they were trying to push the metric system yeah and I remember there was like a concerted effort they're like we're going to have to learn the metric system Goods the universal system at the whole world uses an they gave up the United States gave up what  why was this possible in Canada and not possible in the United States because we're assholes you guys are 20% less assholes at least 20% there I don't know how's that possible I've always thought because I grew up in Boston which is also cold I've always thought cold weather made assholes because it's like you just like fuck it's called fuck that fuck you fuck you because Boston is filled with people that want to get drunk and fight and then the lot of them are really mean which is a great place to grow up you develop a thick skin and  you look like as a comedian it's a great place to start out and do comedy if you learn how to do it right I don't think Boston is mean because of the cold I think yeah I think he's Canadian well the coldest parts of Canada like you know I know lots of people lots of members of my family are from Winnipeg which is seriously cold nicest people nicest people yeah thanks doesn't make any sense it doesn't that's why I said it doesn't my theory sucks yeah - kids be children of very rough immigrants and they say  Aiden these communities and every ghost yes exactly that's what I am so the immigrants of these people that were willing to take a risk and get on a boat and there wasn't even YouTube videos to watch these are Savage people that made it over here and they're really rough and they had rough childhoods and they raised rough children and The Echoes of that persist on the east coast of the United States we the amount of drinking that went on in Irish  communities is it's funny cuz I stumbled across years ago I was I've always been obsessed with drinking alcohol affect have chapter that on it in this book but so years ago turns out that the place in America where alcohol studies as they're called we're really birthed was New Haven which makes person attitude yeah makes perfect sense so in the 50s a bunch of people get really really interested in understanding how drinking works and it in New Haven of course you have the perfect  because you have two very large groups of immigrants you have Irish Italians right in all of knowing that you've got those two to work with and of course they could not be more different in the way they drink so even in immigrant Italian communities in the 50s these are people who are in terms of volume of alcohol consumed way up at the top there drinking with every meal they're making you know why non from the backyards they are but the levels of alcoholism are  noticeable the amount of like social dysfunction associated with drinking Camp I mean it's just not as negligible these are the healthiest triggers you can imagine side by side are the Irish I don't need to tell you that story is very different let me actually what is it it's super interesting question you've got so they're not one groups not richer than the other they come to America not the same time but their 19th century early 20th century come to American law  numbers there are some you know Irish culture looks a lot too but it was Catholic right now to maybe Catholic in different ways but there's a sir on the surface these are you think that they would use the bottle in the same way no the Irish are the the Irish the men are slinking off to the pub and in Italy everyone's gathered around a steaming bowls of pasta and drinking like one and a half glasses of wine mild homemade wine with your dinner it's like night and day  yeah it's unbelievable is it because one is a whiskey culture because Whiskey's rough stuff I mean you really can't have much before you're off the rails yeah there's some of that yeah I did the the attachment to Wine in the Italian Community probably saves them a good deal of their of alcohol-related heartbreak I don't know too much about the actual is there a difference between the way different alcohol effects is the  is the wine alcohol actually affect you by volume by by by the actual percentage of alcohol does it affect you differently than beer or differently than whiskey or differently tequila because that's what people always say oh if I drink tequila I get crazy like people always have these stories but is that true if you have you had a certain percentage of alcohol if we equalize yes equalize the the alcohol concentration is it all the same in here yes because for me wine  wine makes me warm and friendly and it makes me sleepy and it mean it doesn't make me energetic whiskey makes me crazy like I think it's a crazy drug I think when people drink shots of Jack Daniels they just want to go whoa they want to get crazy want to do dumb shit it makes them want to do dumb things shots in particular makes people want to do dumb things makes people get crazy makes people loud it makes people Irish right  yeah it's better you saying well I'm swimming quarter Irish I can get away with it for a little while only a quarter that's it yeah mostly Italian oh I see you're at the cusp of these two drinking tradition yes yes oh I see but Rogan you're fool enough fresh you're fooling us with Rogan yes yes because we would think that you were majority Irish with that yes yeah and I could be dark Irish if you looked at me he would yeah I'm will I'm you know I am a reserved English  Jamaican Jamaicans not big drinkers in in the same kind of the difference actually fascinatingly of the many weird alcohol facts if you look at young people like let's like a college-age young people in America and look at their drinking habits the black students drink and get drunk markedly less than white kids real  all differences in drinking Behavior by race in that at that age Asian students don't drink much either drinking is like a it's like a it's like a white thing it's a crazy white thing increasingly enough or problematic drinking I've always thought that was fascinating this fascinating I don't know the I don't know why that's so as it's revered in our culture more it's yeah I mean getting fucked up is celebrated in white culture well this you know in the alcohol chapter of my book The  I talk about all the strange things that have happened with drinking patterns on campus and I was struck in doing that chapter I was interested in the connection between drinking and drunkenness in sexual assault on campus Because all of those the overwhelming majority if you talk to people who study sexual assault on campus they will tell you that you almost never see one of these cases where both parties aren't drunk right it's which doesn't explain  in them entirely but it's a huge factor in making sense of what happens and when you dig into that you see these like really weird patterns first off when I was in college I did not know and I went to college in Canada not a teetotaling population I did not know a single person who's ever been drunk blackout drunk  and then now if you talk to a 20 year old college student in America they will name friends of theirs who get blackout drunk on a weekly basis what is the drinking age in Canada and what was it when you were in college what has it cause you was 18 yeah I think that might be a big factor I've been talking to friends about this about Europe about how in Europe particularly in Italy and France you're allowed to drink wine at a very young age yeah and the taboo  to aspect of it the forbidden fruit all that goes away it's a just it's a I don't think young kids should be drinking because I think it's terrible for your brain development but I think there's a thing in keeping them from drinking or making it illegal where it becomes so taboo and so intoxicating that they can't wait until they can legally do it or they try to get ahold of it before it's legal and it has a certain excitement to it that just doesn't it doesn't have in  it's of Europe yeah you've given it up kind of so there's all kinds of the things that are new are way less beer and way more hard liquor so hard liquor when I was in school and Canada in the 80s 95% of what we drank was beer it's just not there wasn't any whiskey or even or tequila or a vodka in our party's it's just beer beer kegs keg parties yeah really hard to get blackout drunk on beer I mean black out to get the blackout you've got to be you got to get  like I forgot what the exact number that and drinks or something well it's point you gotta blow like .18 or something I forgotten with us have a magic number where people set for everybody because some people they just get dribble eyes like there's some dudes they'll have a couple of drinks and they get shark eyes you know those those dark like expressionless eyes like hey man you still here yeah like they're just wandering around like like a like a person with doll eyes there's with the issues in there with your shoes back on his just I'll point  does your hippocampus shut down and you cease to be able to have the ability to make memories so that's just that's a very narrow clinical explanation of so they may be a whole different set of manifestations of drunkenness that have to do with alcohols effect on other parts of your brain right the blackout is just about your hippocampus and past a certain blood alcohol concentration your hippocampus just goes offline essentially you just pull the plug on the end cap and then so  and it's coming in is being stored wow so you can continue to communicate I could be blackout drunk right now but does it vary with people does it the number well so yes it would it would it would vary depending I think I'm drinking history in yeah but I mean as a there is it's there's a kind of a there's a consensus figure where most people I wish I it's in my book I wish I could remember I think it's something like .16 or something like that  that if you think of the if the lab the level legal level for drinking forums for driving is .08 I think it's roughly 2x that level and most people at that level will be at risk we'll have at least the beginnings of memory impairment so that feeling when you get really drunk at a party and the next morning you can only remember little bits and pieces of what happened that night that's because your your hippocampus was posed at your moment of peak intoxication your hippocampus was  going to shut down and just wasn't taking any new members really interesting too because some of our most interesting minds and some of the best communicators relied on alcohol heavily Mike and it made that like Hitchens made him a more interesting Communicator when he was drunk when he would have a drink you know I mean right like you would be on Bill Maher you could tell he was he was lit and and and he was so eloquent and so  slit but that beautiful phrasing so remember though that's his an interesting point and a crucial point about blackout which is your hippocampus doesn't necessarily control your your how articulate you are how fluid your speeches it's just about memory so Hitchens could have been the most articulate person in the world in just and but the next morning he would not have remembered a single thing he said on Bill Maher I mean I'm assuming if he was drunk he was black out no but but you don't know this fascinating stories in the literature about  but when people were discovering blackout in the 50s and they would they would be these stories like they would some guy would come in would wake up in Las Vegas and he would say what am I doing in Las Vegas like and they would go and he would see his clothes hanging in the closet and he would say what is going on and then he would like go down to the desk and say what and it's all you checked in last night and he would look in his wallet and he would see you get a plane ticket from Cleveland and they would reconstruct and is a  in fact this very story was told in the one of the big sites medical journals in the 50s the guy reconstructs he's a Salesman living in like st. Louis who gets really really drunk and then his hippocampus shuts down and he continues to function so it goes gets in his car drives to the airport buys a plane ticket goes to Vegas does he does notice in Vegas does whatever he does in Vegas and then wakes up like two days later oh my God hippocampus is suddenly back online what am I doing in Vegas that  two days two days so what is like what is it you can you like that was my point I could be black out right now and still communicate and you wouldn't know it I don't it's not like you can tell I can't tell whether you have a headache can I write no clue so you don't know what's going I mean until we come up with that machine that you were talking about you can't tell that my hippocampus isn't working except if you answer if you ask me the same question this is how you the only way you can do it you had a party you think someone's  blackout ask them the same question over and over again and see if they respond like say why are you asking me so literally I would say wait did you say you heard you're a quarter Irish and then I would just have to wait like say five seconds and say Joe did you see her a quarter Irish and in a certain way you say Malcolm white stop it if you don't say that your blackout drunk but if you do if you could you be blackout drunk and still have like a  tiny memory well he may just ask me that okay so the hippocampus doesn't shut down all at once so what it does is it shuts down slowly so let's imagine we're both doing shots so after I mean I'm quite sure your capacity I'm I mean you're like I'm half your weight am I but I don't know what you are you're like 200 pounds I'm 126 okay so we're going to deal with alcohol very differently but let's assume we're doing shots of tequila  but there's a point where things start to get hazy so you might remember that I asked you that question you might not and then as we keep drinking in our blood alcohol levels get higher and higher at a certain point your hippocampus will completely like the off switch has been thrown so it goes from being sluggish and impaired to just being down like and what brings it back  well you're out but alcohol level has to fall to the point where it can work again so you fall asleep and over the course of eight hours of sleep you know your alcohol is processed by your liver blood alcohol Falls hippocampus snaps back into action wow what a ridiculous drug to be our most socially acceptable drug totally and then the Vegas thing where they give it to you for free of course the in a place where you can gamble which is really sneaky  yeah that's one of the weirder laws ever that a person could literally lose their house while they're blackout drunk crazy I mean in retrospect imagining you were were we let's do a little ranking thing here we have three vices and I'm I know exactly where you're going to be going with this but we have three things we want to prioritize dope alcohol  smoking right cigarettes cigarettes you can ban one actually rank them in order you could we can start from scratch I'm saying Joe was starting over okay what you say goes rank new week so right now The Way We have dealt with these is smoking is is becoming the most taboo of those three cigarettes mmm marijuana second and alcohol is the one that we have the least  Innovations about right my argument would be that that list is exactly backwards  that it should be alcohol should be the most taboo marijuana should be actually not exactly backwards it should be alcohol the most taboo cigarettes the second most marijuana the third that's how I would do yeah I would agree with that yeah yeah so we're basically we have it completely upside down but I think for some people  like  look there's obvious obviously terrible things that happen to you when you smoke cigarettes but every time is it is it pot I see I've smoked a cigarette or two before shows like I've smoked a city I mean or two I've never smoked two in a row but I've smoked a cigarette before I've done shows like Dave Chappelle gave me one of his cigarettes recently Tony hinge Clips give me a cigarette I'm not a cigarette smoker but there's something cool about the Head Rush that you get when you smoke a cigarette I  Tate to say that this is a person who's done a lot of drugs I've done a lot of smoked a lot of pot and I've done psychedelics and I'll talk about them openly I have hesitation about telling people that I have enjoyed a cigarette well because because it's because I think it's so bad for you it's I think when I talk about doing mushrooms I think mushrooms are good for you I think it makes you freak out I think it it illuminates parts of your Consciousness that I think a lot of  guard and protect and shield and I think sometimes doing something that breaks down those walls is good for you ultimately overall there's a little bit of an adjustment period but I think you learn something about the normal State of Consciousness I don't think you learn much when you smoke cigarettes I just think there's this a little bit of a Head Rush that you get out of it but I know so many people that are sick from cigarettes so many people that can't quit them so many people that have died from cancer I mean I personally have known  several people that have died from cancer from smoking cigarettes yeah so I hesitate in saying it but I don't want to be dishonest I've had them yeah I don't smoke cigarettes though I've never bought a pack of that's a cigar smoke cigars I like them sometimes I just think it's a terrible it's a terrible thing to get hooked on yeah yeah and as I would say the same thing with alcohol I know people that have had real problems with alcohol that have been alcoholics and  they have to go to the meetings and you know they're on 12-step programs and you know I would never offer them a drink but if you said hey let's do a shot right now let's celebrate with is a wonderful conversation let's have a glass of whiskey I can have a glass of whiskey and not drink again it doesn't bother me okay I don't have that whatever that is yeah but some people do yeah I hesitate hesitating glorifying that to yeah and for young people scares the shit out of me if I see I've  we drank for the first time when I was probably like I was in high school I think is probably 14 or 15 first time I ever got drunk with my friends you know we got ahold of some Jack Daniels or something and maybe throw us the Irish legal drinking age yes well it's just friends you know listening to Classic Rock and getting drunk in Boston but the it's it's something I occasionally enjoy I enjoy alcohol I like having a drink of wine with a glass of wine with a meal  I like having a drink with friends occasionally but I don't have a problem with it and I know people who do and so I feel weird talking about it knowing those people that do have a problem with it yeah yeah with pot though the people that have a problem with pot it's rare and it's usually people that have some sort of a nun I do believe there there is an issue with people having some sort of an underlying schizophrenic issue that could come from especially high doses if they smoke  a lot of pot and one night they can have a schizophrenic episode I've actually seen it particularly from Edibles have seen it but that's to me that's absolutely the least taboo and I think there's a lot of benefits to pot I think Pop makes you more sociable I think it makes you friendlier maybe some people get paranoid from it but I think that's what that really is is marijuana Illuminating how vulnerable you actually are yeah that we sort of protect ourselves from this overwhelming exes  tential angst that you get when you get high on pot yeah and people say I don't like it makes me paranoid well you know the reality is You're vulnerable we're all very very very vulnerable and we just somehow another make it to look how old are you 56 I'm 52 we made it we made it to Sage somehow or another despite all the paranoia we got here we don't have to I mean it's like really you know life is crazy we're in these metal boxes with combustion engines you know like  trusting the people next to us going 60 miles an hour paying attention not looking at their phone you know it's like it's very very well and then weekend planes and who knows the fuck's going on with the engine this guy's flying it over the sky it's we're very vulnerable all the time just diseases and you know not to mention you know war and all sorts of other things that could fall where it all right yeah I mention everything earthquake fire yeah fires yes no my my thing on this  it is simply the collateral damage yeah the so leave the individual out of it and ask how much Social damage is caused by any of those things and got an alcohol and act number one just by the five Bible yeah you don't make it you know what's amazing to me is how the people who make alcohol have get a free ride it's incredible to me that like if I said to you that I was on the board of Philip Morris you would say that's not  it's pretty screwed up yeah and you would see would be you know problem with it if I said that I'm you know I'm on the board of Anheuser-Busch you probably would hit me up for tickets to the Super Bowl hmm right this is that see where is there's no in terms of the amount of social damage what out what Anheuser-Busch has created has produced a hundred times the social damage then what Philip Morris is produced yeah right like you know so it's like it's five always puzzled but I don't know how it got in our heads like  to treat one like it's completely taboo and the other we kind of shrug you know the there are a bunch of was reading about this recently how many colleges accept not just accept alcohol advertising and sponsorship but you go to a college football game and you know Bud Light will have will be an active sponsor of the event will have some huge relationship with the school this is crazy  he's crazy writers like this is the drug that is causing so many problems for young people particularly on campuses and the schools are hand in glove with the manufacturers of it because it's socially acceptable because it off to worry about repercussions because we give it up we give it a flick and the way that they would never have Marlboro Marlboro yeah oh my God people would pick it yeah whereas it's not you know I don't know this is true the strange kind of we were so messy people are so messy and that is it  that's a very good example of how messy we are  do you I'm I'm now  I didn't really for some reason I hadn't realized you were from Boston why are so many comics from Boston it's a hard place is that what it mean women drunk guys there's no am I right am I right in thinking there just seemed to be like why is it every time I turn around and I listened to some comic and they say well when I was growing up in Boston I'm of course your father's a lot it's a lot there's a lot and there are specific kind of its like the audience is there have a very short attention span  they are they're not going to coddle you if you suck they will boo you off the stage it's terrible for your self-esteem when you're young yeah but it feels good but it's it doesn't just build character it builds the correct approach towards an audience that you have to realize these people do not let these people got babysitter's they spent money they're here they could have been in the movie they could have done a lot of the recreational activities they've chosen to come to the comedy club stop fucking around get to work like like treat this like this is and the consequences of  of bombing of horrific right the feeling is it's one of the worst feelings a person can have yeah so we when was the last time you bombed it's been a while since I bombed but I've heard jokes that ate shit yeah well that's this is there's a process that I go through every two years I put out a special and then I write a new one and during the process of writing a new one you don't write it in a vacuum you write it and then I bring that stuff to The Comedy Store and fortunately with The Comedy Store you're doing 15 minutes Etc  with you know 15 other talented people so you you don't have to be up there for a long time and you get it in the comp the comic store also the audience is very unique in that a lot of them understand that they're going to see these guys like Dave Chappelle and Chris Rock and workout comedy how I see they know it's working properly understand that and like you could joke around about it like that bit sucks I swear to God it's going to be good in about four months Tippets that bits in the oven right now because  Concepts that you have that you go there's got to be a way to make this work but that way that I just did is not the way you always trust the reaction you get another words you don't tell a joke it bombs and you say actually I think it was their problem not mine never that's never their problem there's not a chance in hell you can have a bad audience where a good joke doesn't go over because they're drunk and they're not paying attention to their heckling that's possible yeah but that's the anomaly the it's if you have a bit and you think it's a great been the audience doesn't laugh  laughs they're right you know maybe another audience would laugh maybe you're doing it in the wrong demographic or what have you but most likely that joke sucks yeah and most likely you have these ideas and you need to figure out how to rework them like Chris Rock told me that that he's at his that famous bit that I love black people I hate the n-word right that bid he said it took him a year to work out a  year he said it was bombing he couldn't get it to work right it will fuck up his act but he knew there was a way to do it and then it became one of the greatest bits of all time it became this incredible classic bit but that was from him grinding just chipping away at it reworking it bringing it on stage it eats shit you bring it back you go over it you ponder it you ask questions of other great writers like what do you think you know and they're like well I've been test maybe that and then you try it again  and it keeps doing it he did does it a hundred times or 200 times and then eventually it becomes bulletproof and then he gets it down to that form that you see it on his comedy special where it's just boom punchline bam punchline boom punchline bam and people like that because it's so good but there's a process to doing that and sometimes you have this idea in your head and you like I think there's something there I don't know I just got to figure out how to get into their head yeah and then I got to figure out how to make it in a way what's the most power  we'll wait for people to digest this idea because comedy is essentially a massive gnosis right you're getting the audience to allow you to think for them for a brief period of time and so if you're at your best the punchlines are sneaky they come where you don't expect them you take people on this ride they're assuming because they letting you think for them that you're a thoughtful person you're not going to make them feel bad for liking you and that's one thing that people really hate you say something mean or something thoughtless you portray  yeah yeah you betrayed their trust because they've trusted you to think for them yeah so you have to be considerate about people's sensibilities and feelings you know and when you're especially when you're breaching a sensitive issue like it you have to you have to dance you have to do you have to figure out a way to make this thing compatible to people thought patterns it's funny I you know I don't I'm not a stand-up comedian but I give a lot of speeches like in in conferences and  puppies headings which is a very in some ways a very different animal in some ways quite a similar animal and I've been doing it for 20 odd years now and the thing I'm always that blows me away is how different audiences are hmm like and one thing that you after doing it for about 10 years you start to get a little bit smarter about reading the room at the beginning to know who they  they are and what and it's you know it makes a difference like there are some some audiences are generous and they will if they see the the my case the punchline is not necessarily a joke but it's the payoff to whatever story I'm telling some people when they see it coming if you think about as a line they'll reward you the minute they see it they see it off in the Horizon yeah and I'll be like oh it's coming and they encourage you yes yes some people  we'll wait until the last possible moment and in some people will wait a beat after the punch line is over and then think about it and reward you those three audiences make that makes a world of difference in how you tell the story in your expectation going in in you know because if you if you think it's an early rewarding audience and it's a late rewarding audience you can get you'll be 10 minutes in and you're totally bummed out because you think it's a disaster but in fact it's not like and then  you get I develop all of these short hands about audiences I don't know if they're true or not but in my experience I remember once giving a talk to a group of Engineers on a early on a Monday morning in Minneapolis in February so it's freezing it's 8 o'clock in the morning they're engineers and they're all white guys they're like Norwegian right an incredibly thoughtful interesting audience listened to every word but they are not going to reward you  until they have thought about what you said and they'll wait like you know there's a five second lag between whatever payoff you give and their response right if you go I've also give it a talked to like a group of teachers in New Orleans so there you have a room that is largely female that would be much more diverse so maybe 50% black for example 20 percent Hispanic 30% white just way more they're going to reward  Lord you the minute they see it coming their teachers first of all so their whole thing is about listening rewarding you know seeing the best in something and celebrating it I mean completely different if you go into the engineers in Minneapolis and the teachers in New Orleans with the same expectation you're going to it's going to be a disaster yeah right teachers just want to find a way to love you right and and also their women women I think my experience are far more  generous than men as audience I don't know if overall yeah probably yeah but so that like and I took a long time to figure that out because you for the longest time I would walk away from someone I would think from some toxin would think I just did committed the worst possible offense you're doing a different thing though it's your dance is very different write your first of all you're giving these speeches and you're doing it in these corporate environments you're doing it in conference rooms I would imagine and a different  and of halls and yeah Bright Lights yeah I'm doing it at comedy clubs theaters in arenas so comedy clubs they know what they're getting into their in and it's set up like if you go to the comedy store or the Improv right it's a low ceiling it's a great hot mic is great sound system there's opening acts that warm everybody up before I get there the stage is set and it's an  Armament that it's been established for decades this is a place to go to hear people tell jokes yeah you're doing it you're it's a your you don't have an opening acts you're doing it they don't even know if you're going to be funny they don't know what you're going to do you're going to talk yeah you got to talk about they've been sitting in the same air conditioned arena for six hours one small break I mean it's like they're and this thing to really doing work like yes you know so it's a it is a very very different yeah it's a super interesting  Ting I find it incredibly rewarding and I also find it it's sort of it reaffirms my my my kind of faith in humanity for some reason interesting I really I'm very very happy that I started doing sir doing it years and years ago but just to communicate with large groups of people that reaffirms her faith in what way because I'm always struck by how open I think a lot of the rhetoric in our society now about how Divided We Are  and level that I just think it's I think we're divided online on any talk to people person to person we find a way to find Common Ground yeah and you go to these meetings and you know that half of the room voted one way another half voted the other way and that doesn't come up right doesn't block half of you from appreciating have them appreciating what you're saying they're totally open to to As Long As You Are respectful and take the time to explain what you think and why and what and how it matters to them  them then people will listen and engage in ask really good questions and I don't see so funny the Washington is divided and online is divided I don't I just don't see it else mmm maybe I'm not getting a an accurate picture of the whole country but in in these you know give a talk at the group of whatever Educators in New Orleans yay you don't see this I think when it comes to political discussions that's when people get really divided because I think they feel like  supposed to be divided as really interesting video that I watched yesterday where Donald Trump jr. was getting heckled by these alt-right characters from not being right wing enough I was like holy shit like this this but I I took a lot of pleasure in watching that play out not because I want Donald Jr to get heckled but because this is what I've always said there's people that are just extreme and it doesn't matter if they're in antifa or if  are in the proud boys if they're far left or far right it's the same thing they're just finding an ideology and they're taking it to the extremists level and they're angry at the people aren't woke enough or they're finding an ideology and they take it to the first level and they're angry people that are not separatists that aren't white supremacist they're angry people that like Mexicans at all the any Mexicans I mean there's there's people that are that racist that are mad at subtle racism they're mad at people that there's just people that are  dream and you can't make everyone happy it is impossible and some people don't want to be happy they want to find ways in which you're not woke enough there they're concerned is not the overwhelming good of the world Harmony peace love compatibility communication and Community that's not their concern is their concern is finding ways you're wrong so finding ways that they're right and ways that you're that you're wrong so they'll  they'll find some reason why you're not woken up so it who my response to that was it was slightly different although I think a lot of what you're saying is accurate the reason they got upset with him was that he wouldn't do a QA yes okay yes okay now as someone who's on his book tour and is done been doing this for 20 years let me just say you have to do the QA yeah the QA is symbolically crucial it's like everyone says okay everyone sees you get up there and you  you are prepared bit and I was like okay fine I know you can do your prepared bit but you're asking me to spend $20 on a book on what I want to know is are you someone who is meaningfully engaged in the ideas that you're talking about in your book right so QA is where you prove that to me yes proving your thoughtful prove you care about the stuff prove that you wrote this in someone else didn't prove all those things yeah he wouldn't do it sorry thought it was weird because he just did the view which is like the  the worst way to have a QA I had fun of you but I'm saying in that situation there's everyone's talking everybody over everybody yeah you really don't get a chance to express full thoughts yes yeah if he can hear you if he could do the view he can still be do Q&A at you floozy UCLA forgotten what was it was it really was it but what was interesting too is that what he was using as an excuse was that the the the left-wing media is going to take  his quotes and take them out of context dude I said I've no sympathy for him well in that case no didn't make any sense doesn't make any sense like any sense just say something intelligent and meaningful and you'll be taken seriously that's the way the world works well there's a whole video I mean if someone takes it out of context you could always like show the entire video hey that's out of context here's why is he playing the helpless credits and he's not wear this thing well I mean I someone who's in you know like I said in Arabic I got no sympathy for that either that's what you  that's what you do listen I have no sympathy for me either in that in this case I do not think it's it's been found it very amusing his wife or girlfriend forgotten what she is which of those things she is she she then disses The Crowd about how the only the only way they could get dates is online because nobody would do you see that it's like rule number two after rule number one is do the QA rule number two is don't diss The Audience by by telling them they're all losers like it's just not what do you  well this piece you know that's a thing where people want to just get get you you got them so they want to get you people are booing fuck you you're a loser no no is there a loser yeah you know it's just noises instead of going love love you have a good one guys take care but instead you're right do the QA instead don't don't don't even you know it's not that hard to answer questions I think there's a real problem with answering questions in front of a crowd  though where people screaming out things I think real thoughtful conversation should be had one-on-one and it's it what if like we you and I having this conversation it's great but if there was a third person they're talking to we would have to work that guy in or that girl in we'd have to figure out when she's talking when we're talking and if you got another person okay now you got a real problem now you have four people and it's very difficult if you watch those panel shows some for some reason the network news shows post-election pre-election their  they've still haven't figured that out they'll get seven people on they think it's like more the merrier and like the like the pregame shows on NFL Sunday thanks I got so many guys each one of them says once at us and they're talking over each other and everybody's trying to get a sound bite off everyone has this prepared thing this is zanger I'm going to get that Trump guy with this one and they're ready for it and they trying to interject in someone's talking over them and excuse me I'm talking and then it degrades we have been I want to use the opportunity of being on the show to issue a challenge to double jump  Junior oh like just call me up done and I will accompany you on your book tour and interview want you onstage respectfully will do let's let's do a QA you and me ask you questions I'll do it do you want to do that yes that's something you want to do why do you want to do that I think will be fun what do you think it'd be fun about it well I think it would be in without saying anything that's going to know him to not do it okay yeah so let's be clear about a couple things Okay this not  it would not be a stunt I'm not doing it to do gotcha I would like to read his book thoughtfully and engage with him in the ideas in it and do we see for myself exactly thing I was talking about before is is he does he want to meaningfully engage with those ideas with someone who doesn't necessarily share them right right and that would be for its I would ask for an hour mmm and we can do it in lieu of audience Q&A if he likes I'll just have a  conversation with the Wednesday so just a conversation in front of an audience that would be interesting you don't you see that would you pay to see that yeah I would let's do a his book title is the same as my 2016 Netflix title it's triggered I got their first child on beach by three years that's question number one else they done I noticed that title of your book is the same as stove why are you biting Joe Rogan stuff what's going on over there he probably didn't know it existed  Marv almost released his HBO specials triggered to really yeah I was going to call it triggered to but at least he sent me an e-mail apologizing you know when you get it you want to get there early well you know it's not my term I wouldn't really care if Bill used it or if Donald Trump jr. used it we did obviously has he done or Dawn he's gone to feel calm Dawn that's good question isn't he Donald Trump jr. online but they think they distinguished the dad is Donald oh so they call him  him I don't know that's one of things I could ask presumably in our face off maybe we should do I my limiting it to an hour well yeah let's go Rogan rules let's go like two hours yes me and dodgy died in the second hour we really get into it yeah because that's what happens you could keep it together people can keep it together for 45 minutes you can't keep it together for 3 hours 3 hours you know who a person is you know I once gave a talk in Colombia and the Colombians are take themselves in the best way very seriously right they consider themselves  of the most cultured people do that America yeah they and their they can't they think they speak the most beautiful Spanish and I'm told they may as well they may well do and so I was talking with the was going to go this little kind of lecture tour of major Colombian cities and I was talking to the organizer and and text and a question you ask is well how long I should talk for some period of time and then we'll do qal how long do you think I should talk and the guy goes I don't know house three hours  he was dead serious and you realize like this is the same so when Fidel Castro would give those six hours speeches you realize it's not just I mean Castro a little bit crazy but there's also the our park there are cultures that have an expectation that if you're going to go and hear somebody speak it's not going to be over in 40 minutes right you have to commit to the to the experience and they literally want to me to start at 9 and ended noon weren't the early  campaign speeches for people running for president and the early days this country weren't they like that as well I believe there were long Affairs yeah and then then you get the Gettysburg Address which is what is it six minutes or something hmm so there's oh no what was it the inaugural I forgotten one of Lincoln's most famous speeches very brief is incredibly brief and you realize in that context where people are used to hours and hours and hours what an extraordinary mean it is think about Lincoln as a kind of  badass Entertainer not Entertainer performer so he walks into a world where everyone thinking they're going to be there for two hours he sets up there and he's done in five minutes you realize what a just a power move it is is that lastic like this is a good movie Magic him imagine him so he comes into his like AIDS and says this holds it up and it's you know you've seen it in the in the Lincoln Monument on the mall it's two paragraphs you know  Ford what is it I'm not Canadian four score and seven years ago yes blah blah blah blah blah two paragraphs they must have been like what these people traveled by horse and cart for hours to your USB connection yeah right yeah that's it such a great move it is a good move right we're still talking about it today yeah yeah it's unbelievably beautiful I every time I go to the Lincoln monument and read that I am moved to tears it is insanely gorgeous Bros as a writer  are you must appreciate like economy of words using the right words and the right place and having the right impact and my friend are he has a piece of paper that he has glued to the top of his laptop from Hemingway to quote says the first draft of everything is shit it's true and there's something about someone nailing writing someone just writing something that you go God damn he's just fucking nail that yeah  yeah there you have to maintain the trick is always even though it's false you have to you have to hold in your heart the conviction that there is a way to say this perfectly and beautifully yeah right you can so even when you're in draft one or two or five and it's not there yet you have to believe it's possible and the many you lose that belief that it's possible it's over here when you when you write do you write on paper first and then start typing  like how do you how do you opposite type and then print it out because there's there's certain things structural things you can only see I think when it's on the page and you've got to put all the pages in front of printed out though you don't write longhand at all dude print it out and then we'll I know then I will annotate that draft with a pen so I will do longhand absolutely there's a there there's a night I'm very I think that our thinking is actually quite sensitive to the  the mode that we're using yeah so you think differently when you're typing on a keyboard than when you have a pen in your hand and I think it's not a not one is better than the other they're both good they're just different and yes make sense to use both yeah I agree it's been particularly for me my notes before I go on stage I always write out longhand I mean right out I write my comedy though on my thoughts essay the writer Mall out on a keyboard I'd write typing and then when  about to go on stage like the hour or so before a show I'll write out index cards and sometimes I'll write out entire pits if it's a bit I'm working on and it's kind of new I'll write it all out and it helps tremendously with my memory yeah but something about writing things out but writing to me on paper is so slow it's so slow for me to actually write the words for me to get the thoughts out I want to get the thoughts out with a keyboard because I can just type I can do it quickly I can  get it done what I don't do what a lot of people do do is voice-to-text I don't do that never done that yeah but wait I have a question that occur to you when you saying you're talking about that schedule that you're on that you do us every two years we tell so are you starting when you when you have to sit down and write new material are you starting cold or do you have in the previous year where you can have building up little bits and pieces that you're now putting together yeah I always have little stuff that I lay aside  like I have I have pages and pages of shit that never went anywhere and so I'll go back over that and go man this maybe doesn't take that out there and then I'll introduce all so the usually there's a window of time like say if I my special I film it in July it might not are until August or until October rather so in that window I have those four months to try to create material so what I'll be able to do  in that window say I have a bit that I know works because it's on the special I'll do that bit because the people haven't seen it yet and then after that bit I will sandwich in some new stuff and I'll try to make that new stuff come alive and then I'll add a bit after that I know is good then I'll sandwich and some new salt get make like a like a club sandwich of shitty jokes it's sandwiched in between like legit bits and then one of them will catch fire oh my God this one's Alive Now good  you go back can you see a trajectory in your comedy like when you go back and look at something you were you were a joke that you may have done I don't know eight years ago do you how do you react to it does it I don't work I don't but if I did I probably somewhat I would definitely see flaws I would God that's too wordy or that's that's clunky or that's fit for store I don't like how I acted that out or I don't like maybe that wasn't done yet you know there's a there's a cooking period  added and everybody has a different take on it I've been my friend Anthony Jeselnik has a three year cycle and he might be right he takes the first year he just does clubs in LA and develops material the second year he goes on the road and he goes to comedy clubs in the road the third year he takes at the theaters and then he's ready to film at the end of the third year yeah and you know his last special was excellent but he's just very good comic very good writer but his process might be  right there's some guys that were doing it on a one-year cycle they were doing a new special every year and I don't think that's right that's got to be yeah it's too hard it's not just too hard the material suffers its half cooked a lot of his gooey on the inside it's just not ready yeah this is not done me some of the bits are really good then some of the bits aren't and you have to fill the whole hour and the problem is also when you're doing a special every year you have your own audience so those people love you so they're laughing at stuff that's not even that good  like you have to you have to be doing that in front of a bunch of people that didn't expect to see you yeah that's that's hard to do so a lot a lot of weird tricks you can play on yourself as a comic you know you could think you're better than you are or that the bits are better than they are or that you you don't have to worry about things anymore you don't have to grind you have to throw yourself into the Gladiator pit that is The Comedy Store in a Tuesday night but you do you do there's no other way if you want to be top-notch  have to do the things that top-notch people do there's a Sinister I mean there's no there's no books written on this there's no University course but all the best people will tell you there's a process this is the process you know it's one of the weird art forms in that no one teaches it there's litter anybody who does teach it is terrible there's no one who can this I've never seen like a we're real world class headliner sells out theaters who teaches a course on Comedy never  seen it you know and I couldn't teach you how to do it anyway because your way of doing it would be very different than Jamie's way of doing it which be very different than Steven Wright which is very different than Sam Kinison it's like everybody's got their own weird little thing that makes them funny it's a matter of what is the process how do you how do you get it out who is your candidate for I was loving any particular field there's the Insiders Choice and then there's the popular choice like the most hilarious one is if you ask an  protect who their favorite architect is 99 times out of a hundred you will never have heard of a Target it's always some obscure German guy from like the 30 you know or some like you know experimental Dutch guy who did not even one building and it's like amazing if you you know it's like some you need a church outside of Antwerp and it was it little ones my bag it's always that so who's the who's your insiders I would say The Insider a pic is Dave Attell  because Dave Attell is probably one of the greatest comics of all time it doesn't get enough love because he has no social media presence he wears the same hat and the same shirt and the same jacket and the same pants every day he does no thought whatsoever about his look all he does is just write new and better jokes constantly he's one of the most prolific Comics but he still still have a hard time selling places out and it doesn't make any sense although lately  he and Jeff Ross have done this thing called bumping Mike's where they go onstage and they sort of work together and they talk shit like Jeff will say something funny and then Dave will say something funny and Dave will do his bits and Jeff will make fun of them and they'll go and it's really entertaining and they do a series of shows doing that and that is elevated his profile and for that I'm very very thankful long was he survive in the wilderness he's been out there forever he's have a show on Comedy Central way back in the day called what was it goes on yeah insomnia thank you and it was like  he would go out after shows and they would you know go do weird things in these towns and he would get blackout drunk and he was an alcoholic at the time and he was getting hammered drunk and then he quit he got sober and rare in comedy that someone gets sober and becomes much better but that's what happened with Dave he's a much better comic now than even was then and what it so and what's your when you see someone like that perform and you're you  someone who was extraordinary talented and good what is your emotional reaction to it do you run home and re-examine all the stuff you're doing the I mean what's it certainly inspiring yeah when someone's really good I always want to write that that is the feeling I always Kaka go to work at it work but also I've cherished and held on to like a like a sacred Ember that I'm trying to keep keep alive my fan my my my love of being a fan of stand-up comedy  like I like watching it I'm a fan I love it a guy like going to see it like to this day like I'm working with my friend Joey Diaz tonight who I think is the funniest guy alive I'm happy I'm gonna go see comedy I'm going to see him like that I'd still like watching I still enjoy it I didn't for a while in the early days it was to I was too ambitious and I was judging myself versus them and if someone had a really great joke I wish I thought of it instead of enjoying  it I'll go God why didn't I think of that and that's a it's poison and then I realized luckily I got very lucky that I figure this out early on like you know couple two or three years and I was like I used to love comedy like why am I not loving common because I'm doing calm that's the dumbest fucking thing in the world the reason why I got into stand-up comedy was because I loved watching it now all the sudden I don't like it because I'm jealous or you know or a makes me compare myself to them and I don't like the feeling  or it makes me what is that that's so dumb and then I realized it thankfully and I had a shift and I caught myself yeah and I have managed to cherish and nurture that being a fan that feeling of being an actual fan the enjoyment of stand-up comedy I nurture that so that that to me is critical so when a guy like David tells on stage I can enjoy it I enjoy it I just can I can sit there like an audience member  for and just laugh but are you gonna smash question is when you sit in an audience of 17 you stinking aliens with watching Dave Attell okay are you experiencing him differently than the audience is because you are professional like him I'm sure somewhat but I try to shut down the analysis part of my brain as much as possible I try to shut down like why did he write it like that why doesn't he do it this way I try to just be a fan I try to just watch you know but I'm sure  I know some things are coming or I know the way I would do it or I know Dave very well so I know how he would do it I'm sure there's some sort of a difference between but that's like the same as immediate musician right if you're a musician if you're a guitarist and you watching an amazing guitarist even though they're really good you probably like okay I see what he's doing he's doing this thing like you understand technically like a turn I was my worried as I get older is that increasingly my reactions are simply versions of I would have done it  that's not how I would have done it right right as opposed to so if sake pumpkin comes to me for advice my first I think about oh that's here's the advice I'd like to give on this piece of writing my first someone actually was talking to a friend of mine yesterday brought to me an essay she's working on credibly interesting essay about the role of women in cinema and I give out so we're walking around and I'm telling her my response to it and  after I give it that I first thought was wait did I just say if I was doing it I was I would have done it this way and it was did I you know did I just simply impose my own standards and preferences on her which is not advice that's actually the that's the worst thing which you have to do is inhabit her mind and fix it according to her own intentions and yes I'll and I my I'm constantly paranoid about the notion that I am not  not being truly empathetic at the moment of giving advice I'm just projecting my own and I think that's that's something that happens when you get so when you become so sure of your own methods and professional personality that that's you know that's the kind of I wouldn't have done that when I was 25 because I didn't know what it meant to be to write a Malcolm Gladwell thing where I was just going to be acting as a human being but now I kind of have this thing  and in my skull yeah you have a method I have a method I'm going to try to mix it up but it's probably still riding everybody's method is Dipper ticket with writing right everybody's method is very different yeah everybody's voice is very different there's some key things with comedy one of them is as I said before the economy of words it's very important in comedy if you see the punchline coming too far out it loses impact with the more words you use but if you can get the punch line to the people before they see the punchline come  and that's a gigantic impact that's what my friend Joey Diaz does better than anybody he does he does it better than anybody he sneaks things in on you yeah yeah this reminds me of a long is very lines I've often thought this was the one of the greatest jokes like CIU probably those joke a lot in terms of economy this is the most economical great joke I've ever heard my life and it's from my God I forgot his name this is a polygon forgotten his name  Norm what you look like  he was he was in a lake Bell movie Lake Bell yeah he's an incredibly had his own show on it'll come to me the joke was you know those signs in bathrooms in restaurants you know all staff should wash their hands after using the bathroom right especially Earl  it's so embarrassing it's two words that transform the Ricky Gervais no no it's specially Earl especially so it's like I cannot go into a bathroom anymore without thinking of that joke it's so fantastic it's like you know you didn't like it takes this you know I don't need to explain the joke too it's just a mate two words have created this lasting image of Earl  it's subverted the whole bathroom thing it's I can't go to the bathroom and your head its burned into my head I was it Jamie it's I cannot believe I could I so humiliated I can't remember his name it was in New York kind of Indie comic okay but I just like that Rogue L know but we're getting close even close you know it'll come to me but he but that's like I'm I am amazed by the two words part mmm like it's just  that you can do it with two words just strikes me is the same reason why I'm obsessed I've always had an incredible love of television commercials really yes because the good ones the idea that you can communicate something emotionally powerful or funny or meaningful in 30 seconds is so badass like 30 seconds is nothing right and there are people whose job it is to communicate in some of the  not the run-of-the-mill like 80% of them are relatively straightforward they don't but there are there's a handful that are just magnificent there was one I mean there's a million examples of great ones but there was one really beautiful one  which was a Heineken Dad I've got no I've forgotten again the song they used were a bunch of kids jump in the back of a cab and they start singing a bell div Devoe song and the cab driver they're all young cool hipsters they're all crammed in the back and they're all like a little bit tipsy and the cab drivers this like crusty old school guy and it comes to the chorus and he  chimes in and it's just this moment it's 30 seconds and it's fantastic as you don't you're not expecting that you're thinking you see the Crusty old it's like a Boston cab driver right like some grizzled Irish guy who's like 70 years old and he's three and you think oh you must hate these kids because they're young and beautiful and their tips he has a Friday night and he's driving a cap and then the song comes on the radio and they all start singing along in their kind of drunken way and then he just joins in and this writer was right  it's fantastic and it's 30 seconds like somebody a really great and funny like the remember the Wendy's lady where's the beef oh yeah you'll never forget that one forget it three words where's the beef an image old lady screaming open it up a cheeseburger looking for the beef yeah like I mean how could you not how can you not take off your hat and person who came up with that yeah right if I gave you if you're if you're set with 30 seconds  squirt yeah let me really really hard right and you have to make a point you're trying to sell something yeah try yourself Jerry Seinfeld was going to open up an advertising agency for a while he had thoughts about I know he had done a couple of commercials and apparently he had written some of the commercials and he decided that he was going to write commercials yeah he was going to do that I think he's got so much Seinfeld money's like fuck that why am I working what am I doing I've got a billion dollars in the bank I just go back  more portions I mean his his he doesn't just have a billion dollars in the bank is more coming in coming in yeah it's like constantly coming yeah there's no it's like a yeah it just seems too big to does he did he get this Larry David have the same deal that he does I do not know I would love to know that first I would like to know that too I don't think he does and I would imagine he doesn't but I think he's probably extremely wealthy but he has in my opinion the most underrated sitcom of all time and Curb Your Enthusiasm there's times that I've watched that show  where I've been literally weeping laughing like holding my sides laughing yeah and it's so odd the way he does it you know do you know how he writes things yeah they have like a place where they like okay you're trying to sell me a toaster and Jamie's trying to stop me from buying that toaster but you're mad at Jamie and you're trying to be persuasive at me at the same time that's how they write so it's they just do multiple takes with really talented people and they find Magic  yeah it's Chris I mean it's crazy how open-ended it I've talked to different guys that have been on the show yeah about how they do it it's amazing that you have to love the amount of trust you have to have in your fellow actors yes yeah but it's kind of that's lovely yes particularly contrasted with this incredibly tightly controlled anal writing process that's in place in so many of those shows yes yes yes but it's also why that shows seem so organic yeah  no I mean there's talking over it sounds real it's like I had trouble watching it because it was too real to me I was just cringing with all of the social awkwardness he's just constructing one socially awkward situation after another right and I couldn't because I couldn't distinguish it from real life yes I just I just couldn't bear it much it was it was too much about it did you ever see the one where he has he's over the rapper's house krazee-eyez-killa is he though and the rapper has scar  bass player 24/7 I mean it's Larry David with this rapper it is fucking magic man it's magic it's so good the genius yeah well he's a legitimate genius there's no doubt about that and you know he's also like a real legit Oddball like you drives a Prius you know he is that schlubby guy is probably worth 500 million dollars or something crazy but you know he's not that kind of schlubby guy that's the way he he that's who he is yeah those  guys were in my right they were in New York like barely scraping by forever yeah yeah well he was a stand-up and he and Jerry knew each other from back then and you know he was a weird stand up like it's was an acquired taste it wasn't wasn't you know it wasn't yeah burned down comedy clubs who which Comics are not to your taste I'm not saying that you don't like I mean that are not to your taste that is whose humor just doesn't kind of  well no bunny I mean not that I can think of offhand I don't I wouldn't pay attention one of the things I've gotten really good at as I've gotten older is not paying any attention to things I don't like yeah just just letting it just slide right out of my brain and onto the floor and I'm not interested in it's just I spent so much time when I was younger and stupider worrying about things I don't like being upset if things had don't like well that sucks why do people like that what the fuck's wrong with them  and then realize like what a gigantic waste of resources that is in or just a huge waste of energy yeah that I don't care anymore you know as long as they're not stealing material as long as I'm not Vic make you know doing something terrible to other Comics victimizing as long as I'm not doing that I really don't care so when they're doing well good luck Zen yeah I try Jimmy and it's not it's not a mean it's not a hundred percent it's it's constantly a work of  yes but my philosophy is rooted in some sort of a pragmatic understanding of how my own brain works yeah like you don't you only have so much time and you only have so much energy and if you're wasting your time on things that you don't like that have nothing to do with you people like something like and that's how I feel about music and and movies and so many things there's so many things that I just don't like them at all but some people do I mean you know some people will that I think their music is done  shit but they'll have full Staple Center of people rocking out well I must be wrong it's not me it's not them it's just like everyone's different people have different tastes some people like really cheesy rom-coms they like it they really enjoy it they seek comfort in this movie where you know it's going to work out in the end it's going to it's not like in the end of fucking meteors going to land on the building and kill everybody and the the screen is going to Splatter  her with blood because you know their bodies explode you're not going to see that in this movie and this movie everything's going to work out great it's just like by that I have that feeling about Law and Order In fact what am I I've no idea why anyone would ever watch that show notes and one of my secret goals in life is at some point I would like to be appointed executive producer of Law and Order and I want to do ones that completely subverted franchise so we get you through your all everyone knows exactly how every one of those shows is always going to turn out right and I want to get to minute 47  and just go on some Savage you turn that just appalls and outrages absolutely and then I'll be done I'm just I'm quitting and I'm walking down to the black yeah about fuck and don't tell anybody that Malcolm gladwell's taken over no yeah it'd be totally honest I would push just gently push Dick Wolf aside let me have this one and we're going to like completely and we'll have it you know the the villain the will actually be one of the prosecutors that's what we'll do or something right along those lines and every episode ends like know  oh Country for Old Men style or the shit's over you like what the fuck exactly what but there's something there's a drug in those where they're comforting and that people know that the bad guys going to get caught in the good guy don't know this is a random thought but I don't know any men who watch them and I'm coming to the belief that they are there's something there actually for women and there are a very comforting kind of reassuring fantasy about how  how the world works that he that you know the system is so I had continued my this is incredibly complicated theory that I developed ones about these kinds of things so there's we all know what a western is yes a western is where is conceptually a world in which there is no Law and Order and a Man shows up and imposes personally Law and Order on the territory the community right so  there is also a Eastern what is an Eastern and Eastern is a place where by contrast is a story where they're like at the straight who's four types the Eastern is where there is Law and Order there are so there are institutions of justice but they are have been subverted by people from within so an Eastern would be the Serpico is an Eastern it's a crooked cop who is it's the bad  who has you know screwed up the there's lots of tons and tons of Hollywood movies are are Easterns the northern is the case where Law and Order exists and Law and Order is morally righteous system works Lon show Law & Order is a northern it's a functioning apparatus of Justice which reliably and accurately produces the right the correct result in confronting criminality every single  all day when it's on TV the southern is where the the entire way the southern is all John Grisham novels are Southern's they are where the entire apparatus is corrupt and where the reformer is not an Insider but an outsider so in in every John Grisham novel the same the opposite I love John Anderson has be clear but they are perceived from the same premise which is the system is rotten to the core and only this white knight who comes  from the outside can save us so in the western there is no system in the northern there's system it's fantastic in the in the Eastern the system is reformed from within but in the southern the system has to be reformed from without huh that's my complicated so I feel like anything you can place all art about Law and Order about criminal World criminal justice into one of these four categories and the so the  Brits love the northern so what is you know all of the famous British detective stories are always really becomes Sherlock Holmes yeah is it Northern it's like the system is like and you know there's no corruption in the police department they may be bumbling and Charles got to help them out but no one's you know off on some there's no there's never a case where there's a rotten cop who's selling out every  is there a modern version of the western because Westerns all seem to take place between the time of like fifteen sixteen hundred and eighteen eighty there is solely charge you read the Jack Reacher novels by Lee Child no but I watched one of the movies those are westerners those westerns there's you'll never the whole thing about a question is can you find the police can you find the police officer in a I I challenge you to find a police officer in a leech on  novel they're not nowhere to be found Reacher is a retired the hero is a retired army investigator he's not even in the Army anymore and it's just roaming around the country solving crimes on his own and he'll confront some massive criminal conspiracy and he never calls the cops right that's the whole premise that's so Western you can't call the cops in the classic Western because there's no cops to be found right here in Montana On the Border but reach her it's a it's a 21st century Western  turn so he doesn't call the cops because he doesn't feel like it it's just like they never appear like and he just murders everyone out on his own and then he gets on the train and goes to the next place they're amazing I love them so much do you write fiction no never I mean I I read so many Thrillers I read like I mean I'm probably read  how many do I hear 50 60 70 really I read you know when you go in the airport that's a lot into the Hudson News and you see all those there's a whole like wall of the strollers I have read every single one of that's means you're reading more than one a week yeah easy yeah wow that I read on top of that I read by serious stuff but I devour people send me Publishers send me these things in the mail just because I don't have to buy them anymore they just said they know that I'm obsessed likely  child's although he didn't with his most recent Lee Childs publisher for years you'd send me galleys the main I did cellular not recent happen I think they've forgotten me fucked up fucked up what are you consuming all of it reading or does it any of it book on tape now I'm reading at all yeah I mean I'm reading them in  Breakneck speed and I'm but I do there's a guy I'd love I love one of my favorites is Stephen Hunter who writes the you know they made some movies of his stuff Bob Lee Swagger these sniper movies they're fantastically well written and those the minute he comes out with a new one I read it the instant I mean I have to it's just like there's just such Delights and ever heard always so good really yeah so good hmm anything with the word sniper and it is generally one of his books and  shooter with Mark Wahlberg was one yeah and say that was a good guess but they're the books are fantastic I would recommend them wholeheartedly um how do you have the time to read all these books well that's my job not being Thrillers but my job is reading books literature yeah you know I read very quickly I suppose but I don't watch a lot of TV I just watch a little bit of sports don't really watch much so it is not a lot competing for my  attention but you know I know the book that I will read tonight at dinner so when you set out to write a book do you have a premise stewing in your head where it's just like throbbing we like that's it that's the one or do you halfway in I'll get it I'll start oh so you start a book with a little colonel they'll be a story I'm interested in I'll write it up and then I'll see where we're going to go from there like they'll be every one of my books began  a very very simple one chapter with the I didn't I didn't know what surrounded the chapter but there was something in the book in talking to strangers I got interested in these spy stories these that story of tell of of Ana Montes the Cuban Spy Who Rises to the top of the American intelligence establishment I began with that and I went and talked to the guy who caught her and he had such a fantastic interview with him and that just got me incredibly excited and that got me  this whole thing about here's a woman spying in plain sight for Castro at the top of the American intelligence establishment for 10 years no one catches her even though she's not some master spy she has the codes that she's using in her purse and the radio she's using in a shoebox in her closet like we're not talking about James Bond right and they she does it and no one even comes close to it they all like wow really really smart people and that was such a fascinating notion that even  in the most sophisticated and by definition paranoid agency in the American government they're spies I get away with old stuff like to think anybody ever gets away with it to retirement and then as never else oh absolutely in fact really so I go and I interview the guy who caught this woman Ana Montes and I'm leaving to go back to try back he's in a small town in Wisconsin and I you know as one does I turned off my tape recorder and put it in my bag and I'm walking back  to my car because I'll walk you to your car it's like okay and we're walking down the street and he begins to tell me another story even better than the one I went there to talk to him about which of course my typical is no longer running so don't have the story anymore what the fuck and the story was basically oh there's another bigger spy out there I now know I now realize there is this one thing out there right now well this was three years ago to there was one three years ago that's out there was actually just retired at the implication was they're still there they're bigger and I really was one of those  things where when he put together all the pieces to catch this one woman and a Montes he realized oh there's someone else and then he retired whoa he's like the implication was he couldn't get anyone else interested in finding the other bigger one but he knew there was someone out there but he didn't know the specifically who there were no he knew there was someone I forgot of course because it was his tragic thing where I tried off Mighty find him except back how didn't you just hold on stop stop stop let me put this back on do you think you would have told  you the story if your tape recorder was running don't think so fuck  it's kind of great it's a great he was incredibly after Siri comes in hey Siri record the Gladius right he was it's Chris but I think you know if you're in that world you just assume yeah they all assume they're Spies Like We have them we have them in there's so it's like they're not as maybe they're not as worked up about it as we are I don't know yeah there's there was a story recently where Iran assassinated some people that they  acted were CIA spies and I always wondered like how many people are spies and like you know Homeland style living in some other country assimilating into their culture getting jobs in organizations mm even in terrorist groups yeah infiltrating what a crazy way to live your life well there was a story I told him what a my podcast episodes Region's History season two I think that I ran across I love reading these memoirs  of like mid-level retard Intelligence Officers and tons of them and people only read them and I love there just because invariably like in the middle of the book The tell you some they'll just drop some crazy story and this guy that was the former general counsel to CIA wrote his Memoirs really interesting Memoirs in the middlee tells a story about how the CIA CIA a guy who was a really big deal terrorists in the 70s  and 80s really big deal has a change of heart and comes to the CIA and says I no longer believe in what I'm doing I'd like to work for you and proceeds to work for the CIA for some period of time unknown period of time and he's the he's way up high in Middle Eastern terrorist organization and that fact leaks to the New York Times and a reporter for the New York Times basically  rise a story outing him and the CIA frantically tries to get in touch with him to warn him and he vanishes they think he was killed fuck that reporter because they're it was a very interesting if you're reporting you have something like that though that's what the episode is all about because your whole job is to release information your whole job is to report on things so here you have this bombshell of a story that will make you look like a hero but it could get someone killed  what do you do fuck what I didn't realize is that there's a established pattern of people at the intelligence services and editors of newspapers talk all the time yeah about things like this like so they have Arrangements yeah they haven't put that in this case the arrangement didn't work

I'm doing Rogen in two hours I gotta go do a podcast what are you writing I was just writing podcast because I don't know if he's on a podcast or a podcast Tod Tod knows I'm just I'm just calling you know you're taking notes yeah yeah yeah it just gonna be like it's just going to me I just wanted Joe to stop bullying me I didn't want you to talk  shit because every time I just trying to help every time I see him so he'd be like this we have regular conversation to hit just start doing like this I like this thing about to hit me right he said he say what's up with the podcast we going to shoot that shit to the Moon come on man by doing this yeah yeah it's the high school I'm just trying to get to a good you're too good to not have a podcast and I said and I'm going to tell you I could go and fight a thousand thousand people I ain't trippin off that shit  it was just something about me talking to myself talking to myself I never did that well 44 minutes yes yeah well do you ever talk to you know what do I gotta let you gotta talk to yourself but I never did it but you know what you got to stop bro let me say I got to say this no the real talk but his fans talking about and I confront I was  nervous about it and like I was like ah and then when I did it today when I finished it I felt good as shit so then I met I felt like this I was like oh it's Bobby the old son it's on see just how to get moving that's all you needed you just need to launch who's we're good they podcast off with Joe Rogan producer in a reserve producer and Jamie Vernon doing the technical teams Jamie was mad at me at first though anyway try help me out  okay Jamie you're absolutely right I agree with you 100% but what the Lully I said what can I do to help me and you we're gonna make it happen and we worked it out I worked it out he didn't want to return my internet on he was like he didn't want put me online and  and so there's a couple of companies that offer like a turnkey sort of situation what is the one who does Eric Weinstein's podcast and it does Google that they have a service they have a company and they just did they get all the ads for you and they take a certain percent and then they set up a studio for you don't have to think about shit you just go in and be yourself we know it's crazy not that I'm jumping on Don else Dan why  yeah go ahead you can tell what's wrong with that I used to that maybe for the last few months since we started the whole of the American Saga series people been pushing me to do a podcast I love listening to you I end up not doing one but we have one for the show of course that kind of does you know like after the show go on you can go and listen and hear  you know more inside details of the story but still doing that process that was like you need to do a podcast with us because  just the way you think we just need more people with that kind of thinking you know yeah so he said as he talked to us you don't talk to herself but then after he was finished talking to herself for 44 minutes he felt a weight come off him how was it but there's a scripture on that bro what is the scripture is in the bhagavad-gita whoo that's correct no no no I don't know I don't know the Quran is the crew on all right so the bhagavad-gita smells means the song of God just  Gita Kita the Gita right it's actually the words of Krishna and he says contemplation which yourself which is talking with yourself  will take you further than praying whoo okay and if a man is not contemplating right if you're not know what are you doing it verbally like right now we're talking out loud we all got that voice and I had yeah you have that voice was like yo so I put the condom on and not that  is that contemplation that makes us better is that reflection of what we did what we're gonna do and you knew verbalize it even out loud I mean the spoken word it's even more powerful you get it out that's how I felt but it was a part of was like I was not let Joe talk shit to me how was I fuck that baby not doing it but I'm glad I did it man the father did not reach him yeah yeah you gotta do a podcast he should  good I think look bad but the most important thing is that you have a voice like you're an interesting guy if you did a podcast would be interesting because a lot of people it's good to have a bunch of different people doing it from all different different styles of art different person is already have a person yeah has already been interested in people so what people want to 20 keep getting dances are you how can you give it to him today I'd like he's like I just  come out like a man that's a death so fucking easy that's a no-brainer what is the bhagavad-gita it's you and Duncan Trussell the only people call it the butterfly my Gita that's hilarious that's all that's an amazing book man that's what Oppenheimer quoted when he watched the first atomic bomb blow off so I am become death destroyer of worlds so quote right from the Bhagavad Gita yeah that's crazy shit that's it yeah that's a that is a fascinating book man there's all sorts of Illusions till  like UFOs and shit I've talked about well what the Mahabharata which is a longer version yeah so the bhagavad-gita is about 700 versus that's tooken out of the Mahabharata which is one of the longest it's not the longest poem it's in the top ten how do you say is it Mahabharata how do you say it yeah you might that be is in they don't know if that be a silent yeah that's the one  photos with existing Mahabharata up silent be there's someone that's gonna be in that that be makes noise right but it's there's vimanas in that right where there's flying crafts there's a bunch of weird shit the people faced extreme try to figure out what the fuck are they talking about yeah and you know that ancient civilization was measuring the called coppers every thirty five thousand years you know and it was saying you know Jun Cai  Copper's you know like that's that's what that's like K APPA T like cappadonna APPA oh I got a tennis eat while I want to just make a disclaimer real quick I have a tendency to pronounce words the way I pronounce have a tendency to listen to the words where you pronounce it  oh you never split a six now I didn't I'm very white hate know how many I didn't even know what he's talking about I had to like go over it without the bars you said you spell but I said hip-hop him to see what he was asking me about Sugar Hill and I said yeah I remember that and then I started singing it I don't think I was actually about sugar he'll say oh no I remember yeah you asked me if I knew no no this is why I said you always pissed 16  he was like just what you told me Joe you said I don't have time to spend $6 I don't have it though don't it I have much better enjoy it you said Joe and you're listening to it I've time that's what Joe you said I have much better things to do my time to dispute 16 I don't think that's what I said I'm pretty sure that's what you said what I said was I'm too busy to do one more thing and I like rap but I don't like to do it maybe I would love it but I'm not going to and I mean Tom okay it's not you think yeah  the top means don't try to twist it to do I don't just how dare you would so I am the producer of you treating me like this quoting edit it edit it out as edit it edit this we were talking about how few white rappers ever actually make it like the tiny percentage in comparison to the ones who try it like how many of them tried you got to think this must be millions and millions of tried it but you're right like this is like a small handful of guys well it all the obvious  is a small handful period for here uh it's also so that's true too so if you look at the ratio number ratio Gotham as we talk you'll see I'm always I'm always pulling some numbers into things but if you look at the ratio let's say 1 million white guys tried right five made it let's say 50 million blacks tried he said I'm a hmm so so it's usually the ratio right there anymore doing I see what yeah yeah makes sense but hip-hop let me just say  about hip hop because I can so I can see that right it's dead no Hilltop be nervous she try to kill it but go ahead but the beautiful thing is that hip-hop is Abyss as one of those no not so good I'm you know I like I like this this this energy here but hip-hop is a pure American  creation culture yes it's like it's like it's you know people try to trace it nah man trace it right here yeah and when it was formed right it's definitely you know you know a lot of young black men you know you to go back to cool Hoke and Grandmaster Flash and and Melle Mel and spoonie gee you know you can go back to the classes you know Grandmaster Caz right but within Grandmaster Caz crew and coconuts brother you got Charlie Chase right so  got the Spanish Brothers there within our first hip-hop songs that we love you know LL Cool J Rock the bells oh gosh who produced that Rick Rubin Hmm got the white brother oh yeah we was talking about it so so the so the youth culture of America at that time right even with Fab 5 Freddy going down you know town to the CBGB cloud and all that and Blondie and all these all these things was melding from our culture now whereas of course  it's a dominantly a black expression right is there we can say we dominated the culture but it took angles from every other part of New York to make it exists and that means it took Spanish brothers and their culture it took out white brothers and their culture to all forming and then of course when Wu-Tang came he bought the Asian culture you know I mean yeah and and okay when you say that it's like it came in like a thunderstorm they like me so so we searched so so  we should be proud to know that it's that it you know that it's like an inclusive American art form it is you know me and look Bruce Lee who was an American right people who got to you know he represents the Asian culture but he was born in America when back made it big in Hong Kong and came back to America and took it to the next level again and when you look at some of those breakdance moves and some of the philosophies that he bought two mixing more Styles together you know gee  condo which means the way of the intercepting fist or also the way of he combined boxing with fencing with with with our Wing Chun yes fight he put all those mma's together before it was even that right when I was taboo exactly hip-hop also is that same type of product when you do have the soul of James Brown The Jazz of the loneliest monk you know I mean The Rock beat of Billy Squier yeah  I got a big beat or Honky Tonk Woman by Rolling Stones those are breakbeats but yet you also got the light and filling of the Mambo Kings and songs like Apache in the makes you think do you think Hip-hop is evolving and not just because is it evolving in a sense of the creativity of it I think it's because the people they got a situation now where it don't have to evolve among people have found a way to make money off of something that people may not agree  it is like hot but do you think Hip-hop is evolving yes it always evolved right so it's part of the evolution we're seeing now is where as we and my generation we even lied on using that was created before us because we went to we came into town with it took music programs out of school right so you didn't learn how to play a guitar piano good and your music equipment or your instrument became your turntables it became your drum machine eventually became I would say  sampler and then we sampled a lot of songs a lot of breaks from old records that already existed right right but this generation right they're not actually Force the sample they actually could take their Chi board their drum machine their laptop and just create and on their phone to yeah and all their phone is just create the beat right and so now the beat has no historical reference to it in a sense of though that was a James Brown stepping out of the Marvin Gaye snap below this that's just it  Chad who what he did Fruity Loops into some calls progressing together or whether he sat there on his garage band on his phone and and hit the guitar program that comes with it or whatever the creativity of it is now having this form of originality but now of course once I don't like that happens there's a formula so we keep hearing that same formula exists like right but I think one of the greatest evolution of hip-hop right is and as  several I'm gonna use the word Evolution Loosely because when I think about the cold Crush brothers and the for Some D's they did this anyway in the beginning but hip-hop has become more melodic now than it did in the 90s and the early 2000s right so when I mean by that you know rappers now you know you know I'm just so D and I did it in a man Liney like it's all Melody small you know it's all chanting right has the real  gay chant vibe to it when we was doing it I smoke on the mic like Smokin Joe Frazier the Ellie's right it was all aggressive chop lap you don't think so so the see that it evolves to this melodic format they look at Kanye he's now took it to gospel its melodic as hell right now Luke took it to the Snoop Lion but still down he was Snoop was really successful to Snoop Lion think didn't wasn't that successful but the one he won the out gospel but I think he was getting towards denominator  and like in stayed on top of billboard for a while yeah and now Kanye is in that well so so it's evolving right and church even different now you got fucking pussy in Preachers now when you get what you mean now no don't just say that Viral no I'm just sad no I'm sorry  Liz right it was like the preachers but he's busy for a while but this one got caught on camera and he got Carl said I'm PornHub it like they do report no no yo yo it's real okay women do a little signs like if you was on a dirt deserted island who would you want to be and they got somebody else they got somebody else to get to proceed preacher named Isabel I know it's got a discussed it was he from from New York I don't know he from down south they aren't they aren't God hard down there  they are it's hard hard hard hard blocked it all out with Pussycat So that you can't see ya pussy and I'm a little

especially so now I talk shit about vegans and shit I took a shit about plant-based motherfuckers but I know now like what the way people cook it and the more options is more options to eat like that didn't was when I was coming when I was  Anna it was just like that Sunrise Patty that's the only vegetarian and they can tell you eat some broccoli or carrots or something but it wasn't no options in

men like how do you do you mostly a whole food diet or supplement I don't really monitor yo right I don't eat a lot personally you know I mean like on a good on a good day for the if I'm on my best the best Reza I'm eating once a day anyway once a day yeah like I haven't eaten today really know and I mean I got something I got  the goal of this I got some lettuce wraps yo you give him that shit you trying to give me something that I want to eat after I make finish this what's the yo why you act like I'm against being a vegan I'm not guessing I'm saying is you know I don't know a lot of f-bombs you would eat one of those right what's this the weeds right butter no it's just nut butter not yeah  a lot of those  cool with a liquid diet I'm just not comfortable with it tastes good and if I just need nutrition work real quick there's no bullshit okay it's great shit man well I like copying this reading it is sound makes so much sense very healthy it's just basically just protein them organic dark chocolate I'm going to say this to you brother no no offense on this man why you keep rewinding hey because become everything you say this to you  but every time you say something to me you said it like a before you start tripping out there I'm not alright this is for you okay no no it has dark chocolate in it okay so dark chocolate is known to reduce high blood pressure right us as black men will you know they say we have high blood pressure right basically baseball has been in America not getting that real natural son right and  and a high sodium diet understand blood pressures dark chocolate helps reduce it so this is good for me yeah it's not everybody but why you got just directed at me like I need dark chocolate well brother I'm just saying I don't even know why you needed to have a chocolate I don't know you know what I'm just next no no I'm just saying you keep pointing at me and shit I'm sorry I like dark chocolate like everybody else like dark chocolate you like milk chocolate or dark chocolate  like dark chocolate you know what you know what no it's great watch this shit on TV this is my shit box what I'm TV the food that made America anybody watch that yeah what is it yo playing no no it's a maybe it's a History Channel one of them stations but they go into the Hershey Company the mall  logs they cover Kellogg's yo check out Hotel log start yo I gotta tell story about how I got here you know why black people like Pepsi but hold on let him tell the Kellogg story because you know I'm just gonna believe this okay catalogue star because he's us a doctor with a little they call it sanitary what they call it a sanitarium yeah that doesn't sound that we had announced the world's wrong whatever it is we know he's a doctor yeah no sanitarium their descendents Battle Creek sanitarium yeah so he's  they're never knew that motherfucker motherfucker yo he invented cereal boxes forever he invents cereal to calm people sexual desire you know diet because they because they because they were sick there and he thought he thought the best way to get the nutrients he would bake all this drain together and then break it up and sort of talk  no you didn't pour milk his brother actually was the one that was like put some milk in it always immediately story right so Kellogg's is doing this shit his brothers like yo listen it's money in this we could sell this  but Kellogg's he's a doctor he's already making money like nah man look his brothers little look dyslexia yeah well he kind of got it together sometimes by the love between doing all that sun let's go to work and do what I tell you right right so he's going to work do what he tells them and then one guy comes over to the sanatorium no money can afford to pay he has to work it off right so let him work it off right he's working he's eating the cereal every morning and he's just checking out the sanitarium and he go he looks around his name is mr. post  misterpost yeah he leaves the sanitarium and before Kellogg starts Kellogg's cereal mr. Poe started posterior only he came and blew up I forgot about posts yo for real it was it beef was they had like Syria which oh it was Sylvia will be for the for the whole like it's no good  is what do you want anything you know what black people like poop sounds like you're trying to be racist right and he explains 3 to me back in like the 30s with Coca-Cola and Pepsi was the to vine bottling companies and Coca-Cola was smashed and Pepsi on sales right like like a hundred twenty five minutes like three million in sales per year right and Pepsi needed to do something to get a different audience so Pepsi painted basically Coke to be either racist or not really care  in about the black community and perhaps was the first corporation that started putting black people on the cover of the posters and it don't be an affluent like like doctors nurses they think the concern thing you saw was like Aunt Jemima shipwright big perhaps he was the first ones to start doing that and Pepsi hired an ad agency 12 black guys I think was in Louisiana to go out and do Juke joints and touch the black community and what Pepsi did was like quantity wise like save yet  now this is a Pepsi 10 ounce of Coke Pepsi cope with Charles like 27th and Pepsi would charge like Ten Cent but based you getting doubled you want you giving me the sugar it don't matter you can charge it up right yeah so that's the reason and then if you think about that through generations Generations that's the reason why a person could be disconnected from a certain brand you said think about it if you if you like if you at home right you got Pepsi and Coke and did you hear somebody say man we don't drink that coke man I said white people soda you don't said you won't drink it and that's what I did and they and it's a book called  It's called is a book called the real Jamie pop it up the real Pepsi challenge the real Pepsi challenge that's rest and I'm like why did I think this would be I looked into trying to get the rights to have some kind of way I got blocked early on maybe I had a right Jus tank laying on my team won pioneering company broke the color barrier in 1940's American businesses wow and see that you wouldn't see him back  then he wasn't seeing posters of of a working mom you were just seeing like serving stuff and that's when is there a point audio version of that book about fuck I gotta get it but you can see the Pew could just see you really you could just see the outfits they was wearing and like the Pepsi dudes they was a Pepsi bottle there was a Pepsi niggas they will just to have money to go throw parties and shit right right I know there's it was like  now to there early they use coca leaves and then they extract medical cocaine from that and then there's a company that makes yep there's a company that extracts it for them and makes medical cocaine and they have they have coca leaves that are shipped to Coca-Cola to make Coca-Cola has a certain flavor that those coca leaves give it no cocaine anymore but the original coakley's no but this is a company that's connected to it that actually uses those cocoa  and extracts the medical there is medical containers lidocaine yeah use it for different like surgeries and she like that even in the all right well yeah and in the series the food that made America they going to Coca-Cola crazy take it to buy coke and y'all he said but then Venture of Coca-Cola was hooked on coke come on another drug he was hooked on I forgot you can look it up right he's hooked also other more  laughing he's hooked on morphine right so he's trying to counter it he's trying to counter his cocaine basically oh my God but he'd bawling but but check it out but the cocoa the cocoa Leaf by the cocoa plant which is actually an African plant you know I mean we always think of it as being a Colombian and I was like coffee or coffee all came from Ethiopia it's that kind of party they go on to it he makes he makes cocoa and mix cocoa the cocoa plant  through all the ingredients together and he made Coca-Cola so he made a cocktail they end up take off the morphine yeah individual formula still unknown for good I mean no I mean imagine what it'd be like Papa lies Coca-Cola when it had cocaine in it you like cracks wow yo you like streets coked-up was that motherfucker's really thirsty now he'll it right now can you imagine what that what was the decision like when did they all get together and we got to take the fucking cocaine out of Coca-Cola why don't they  it together and together they did it for people like with had with dental industry like issues with their mouth is about but that wasn't yeah - yeah yeah yeah lidocaine lidocaine the using surgeries okay yeah well I had my deviated septum fix I had a broken nose they straighten it out and they flooded with lidocaine to numb it it's like a cousin of cocaine yeah it doesn't get you high makes you feel like shit it doesn't  but you feel like disconnected and weird like they gave me a pretty good dose when they fix my nose and I remember I went to a restaurant like either that night or the day after I think it was that night and I was I was feeling terrible like I'm like I don't I can't taste anything I feel shaky and weird like I'm not on cocaine but it's like weird cuz do anything to your appetite or anything yeah I didn't wasn't that hungry well yeah fucked with me it just made me feel shitty I just felt like felt like my heart was beating too fast I felt weird  this is a felt like something was off it didn't make any sense but they use it just to numb you up for surgeries it's real common I've never had an issue real common joint injuries and shit like that shoot you up with lidocaine a new subscriber this is this is the word against the other guy that came like a lion the lion is shooting the shit out of it  fuck you can feel goddamn things all numbed up well no lidocaine in this this is strictly no dry roasted macadamia nuts no mechanic dark chocolate see the next part is better on the back than the front right yeah you first open it yeah at least one and chocolate cane syrup cocoa powder cocoa butter crystals he saw it saw and dark chocolate let's put this in my pocket take this take it don't you do what you put it on top of something like I just ripped out and shoot it right  hard so like after

love when people do that how much something that's just over the top and what part is were starving me is that the cow  ass come on man I was asking brother mask you know lot of meat is made from the well the meat is made from the legs the romps you know a lot of roasts and you have a nice slim jims yeah it says right on it said beef lips hmm beep beef ass asshole beef heart heart good for you okay well lips and assholes don't even want to talk about meat what you mean good luck the real problem is really the preservatives and all the stuff they put in it to make sure you roll it up in a fucking to  tube and stick it in a tray and let it sit there for weeks and months on end and it's meat it's not supposed to sit there like I don't care how you seal it if you unless you're drying it out like beef jerky and then even beef jerky's got a shelf life and make it last as long as it can for bacteria takes it over but it's a tissue so that we don't they that's why they would dry it you know they would dry meat so they can carry with them on the road but I didn't plan on staying forever you know like does it stays pretty long but that's Slim Jims they add bunch of stuff to those processed ones I have  turkey jerky or somewhere from somewhere after that was wack but it was pretty good some turkey jerky not a fan of turkey it's a weird choice for food it's like chicken tastes better but for black people turkey anything feels like you just cleanse yourself who makes the best turkey burger  turkey burger can change your life you could get me on the road of being a vegetarian well you know what that's the path I took I started first I stopped letting me and then I went to actually turkey burgers turkey pastrami turkey turkey chop meat for my spaghetti you know I mean it may be chicken burgers and then one day I was eating like I when I was younger I can knock about 30 chicken wing you know I mean any man but one day he pointed me like anybody  3030 chicken wings right Joe I can knock out 32 Ewing's a hundred percent all right so on and so on the on the  the 29th chicken wing my teeth hit the bone King and my mind said no more dead bird really isn't man you eat you in New York City were all these pigeons flying around and here you are supposed to be an intelligent human being you eating on a dead bird and I was like that sounds pretty stupid to me and I never ate it again that's interesting they were that's funny is that pigeons were actually brought here for food that's what Stephen ironic about us listen  Mama's Fried Chicken Holland Fried Chicken Nextdoor Fried Chicken Brooklyn Fried Chicken remember we have the big chicken stand it was crowned Fried Chicken double crowns Fried Chicken all the Queen's Misfortune and you had to get to take the hot wings because the hot wings they had to make a right on the spot to have a drink and be in the window for a long time out of what you got all of a sudden pigeon population I pay attention to this type of shit peasant population of New York City  T drop down we just doing the movie Ghost Dog we had to get pigeons from Jersey the present a ghost dog yelled epistle combination drop down bro and I was like yo dead bird so I never ate chicken again pigeons are edible the good it's called squab that's what pigeon is a famous British name yeah it's pigeons as well come on some menus they just called pigeon that's what I feel like you be calling anything but chicken you know there's some some bird  are actually red meat like sandhill crane ever see this and they call it rib eye in the sky it's crazy we said is that eat it we don't take a red meat the breast is a red mean it looks like a steak from a crane from a crane doesn't it's like a bird that flies in the sky giant ass fucking white bird flies in the sky this is one of menu yeah you can get it on some menus in Texas I believe but it's a wild game animal I will try wow gets a pet that's what it looks like look at it  that looks like just a joke son I know it looks like steak that's suvi my friend that's your style Su V so if you want something that's what it looks like yeah praise actually is a good example of relationships a crane will fly across the country or the world whatever go to The Mating place with the other homies at right meet somebody  fly home and went of AIDS fly back the mighty that dude and stay married for the whole life Wow unless my shoot him down and cook them really you know I mean somebody had together they don't they don't go back and find it  ever seen a crane like true go for like a puppy why don't all come full panel of the kind of yeah but crazed look like that would look like they look at the weight be with somebody for that long they want to get shot it's want to be delicious at the heart of that thing is read me no the breast that's what those images are that pull that images that's all sandhill crane breasts their breast is like beef yes that that on the right to that a little bit looks like a rib eye steak it's delete the grill marks George Foreman  real Style real Mars it's a grill Mario Mark Smith George Foreman Grill that's the heartbeat right yeah I don't know so that's the real me I don't care even though I go to vegan restaurants and be like  vegan fish hmm don't call it vegan fish for me right it's not fish right it's just a food if you want to say or whatever it is flavored like you don't like barbecue flavored chips or something like that you could say flavored artificially flavored fish but do you know the mind is not going to respond like that they got to do something to the mind and makes it still in Tyson yes I like I said you know that's vegan fur ain't no such thing as V gopher black it's not such thing as vegan for but if you are vegan  fucker you going to buy that because you heard the word vegan fur how about vegan leather of the real Vela it will work like that whether it will work how about that feather feather like flattered that is instead of no you do know that's gonna say all right how about that ver like this a ver jacket but remember pleather versus good yeah pleather vasek leather yeah yo you should have blow up with the V on anything but the video taken by you know by it Vic  yeah instead of chicken you can defeat you set the v in there jiggle like how you do that's my next question right you can't tell a chick you want this Vic what does vickerman got some Vicki what is Vicki what this Vic put the v in it take the word vegan and make some outside of don't tell me that you're giving me a vegan steak it ain't a steak homie steak is a particular part of the animal that's why we call it a steak that ham is a particular  part of the animals was called the ham what do you think they come up with you I don't think they care about it being a vegan I don't think they care about you as much as the dump  way to do it you give them that and go look you could just start with this you know tastes a lot like a burger you miss Burgers just go to this one you need a permit you have you ever had one know I had one the problem is it's a lot of oils there's a lot it's like it's very process I think if you're going to eat vegan you can eat you should eat Whole Foods but the person real food I don't want you Joe they want a motherfucker like me they don't want you to know he's doing to herself nicely  she talked about  person that eats yeah and you'll be like this you keep telling yourself hold on nah that shit tastes like me to know what if somebody told me it's like your cafeteria High School cafeteria Burger I guess what is like Jojo guess what that was disgusting to you I wanted that burger so bad saying this High School cafeteria Burgers casual that's what it does work that catch up in their clothes back the bun that's what you said not bad does it does never think about it it is like a cafeteria just cafeteria Burgers did weren't a hundred percent meat right  yeah even the early majority yeah right there just trying to fill you up you're trying to save money and fill it was good but another thing when it did for me when I ate the burger it made me feel good eating a burger that I thought was all plant based and what about it do it right  wife to pull out one of the motherfucking impossible burgers are Beyond Belinda beyond the Beyond what's man above and beyond what's better than possible or the people on both brand but it's the same thing it's the same concept but it's different titles but it's more delicious is one more delicious you gotta ask different people well well well let me say to me speak on it the impossible Burgers only a variable in restaurants right so you can't really get it in your crib but to be on both of you guys could get it they got a lot of shit you go to Gelson  and you need to be on sausage get Beyond whatever what do you think about lab-created meets they're on the verge and they've already created some they're on the verge of being able to mass-produce like full meat that has never been in an animal well that's weird that's the Matrix baby what is the meat that has never been an animal it's basically they've taken all the building blocks for meat and they've somehow or another what's Google how they do it before I butcher  the actual expedite I'm sitting here giving out a makeup that's what that's what that's the Matrix remember the major nature maybe he was like yo I was eating a steak is like I just want to be an important person it what it was he was like it's not a real stick is just right but this is a real stake not just has all the nutrition the real State that's not a real state right but it is actual flesh it just was never connected to a living organ on paper like no it's not no it's actual flesh like it has the essential amino acid profile of steak but it has nothing to do with an actual  organism like it's never been alive it's not like you killed it to make it there's some process by which they are able to create this that I don't understand and we're trying to figure out what it is what is known and what they're doing to me yeah but they don't know what the fuck is going to happen to people  this is a different thing and what this is is meat without death and I don't know if it's real well I don't know it's I'm sorry I know it's real in the sense that they they have done it right I don't know if they can mass-produce it I don't know if it's viable and I don't know where they get it and I understand how the process starts but if so motherfucker confused but if you can have it with no ethical moral or health consideration if free if they figure out how to do it because meet essentially  Lee is a bunch of molecules it's a bunch of particles it's a bunch of things put together as people get more and more intelligent and they have more and more control over their environment they're going to get to a point where they can recreate all life right and me is a step in the direction of the things we like this how much can you charge for it well I don't know but it's like cell phones cell phones used to be that Michael Douglas thing on the front Beach that's something I've big old brick was probably a lot of money now everybody's got a goddamn phone everybody yeah but how much would I pay but a shitty phone now a to  now phone now it was a goddamn world changer 13 years ago you'd freak people the fuck out if you had the cheapest mass-produced Android phone you brought it to the Past you showed people they'd freak the fuck out I think that's the same with everything and as the talk technology to create viable options for people who are healthier when they eat meat but don't want to be a part of animal agriculture this is water there but like maybe this is about three months ago and it was big about how reading  meat does not digest yeah no no they was reverse it it was basically saying after all these years well scientists have figured out that for you isn't that bad for you that was it that was it that was a nickel both well here's the thing please do look it goes both ways right Rose this is good for you did they say it's bad for you and then you got an individual so you know what it's good for me bad for her right but I will say that there's a way to  create something that will save other lives yet created yeah right that's that's that's the evolution of man they should be able to say you know what we have the kill all these animals to get a coat right now we don't have to do that week of form we have a formula to make a coat that's going to keep you just as warm keep you just as serve the purpose and knees and no nothing has to die for it right the same way re-educate people then well you could do that the same way we're human  who human work right if you know you know you know not to go back to historical right but machines come and replace the the the mandatory Enos of human physical labor in certain industries right yeah okay that's better I could so now you don't have to subjugate somebody to do that and are cost-effective friend is more cost-effective it's better for it's more Humane and all the reality right so we support that but the Catch-22 if he's got to be conscious of as  as you know and your own Lifetime right if somebody's telling me that look you could do this and I'm still going to have my let's say 70 years on the planet then your do it but if I'm doing it and you want to turn my 70 years or 50 years I don't want to make that bet you know I mean I understand what you're saying I think that's what how we that's what we watch out for with anything even with the what even with the you know the vegan diet or the pelotonia and died all these different things  if is going to Hash your life that's the biggest Equity you got is your time of your life there then lean towards it but if there's a Chance is going to bully take away your life but but yeah yeah pet hustle bully and you you was bullying me all this why you know what he's doing  as he go fuck these I'm sick of these do you not listen if you won't be safe is like he called his pelotonia Paleolithic but we're we're talking about Joey Diaz calling what did he call you Jordi is caught me Rondell Darlings my daughter's a great guy I love this guy we fucking hang around you gotta Spencer come on he said he's like you to fuck my homeboy he said give it up for a Rondell Darlings  he's had when he doesn't show he does that with your diets and here's the thing about diets it's everybody's different everybody's body is different people were some people respond better to a vegan diet than others some people respond better to a carnivore diet than others everybody's got a different  make moves like we're talking earlier about people being a allergic to peanuts right people have to make adjustments there's some people that are allergic to certain green vegetables now there's some people have weird reactions to kale and all kinds of other things with oxalates in them Spanish motherfuckers allergic to healthy shit like one of my friends I'm allergic to pretty much all salads I'm like that's the first segue into being healthy over the motherfucker  a salad or people are allergic to cheese I'm allergic to vegetables that's crazy some people are though yeah so girls are large come did you know that I did not know that some girls allergic body is their Learners to their man's come it's not that was our little all over the place it was no matter where you go carving name on the belly  I'll show you what I can only drink Seven up that's it seven up another baby she said it like I don't like what I'm like I don't like water she don't drink water yeah all right that's not gonna but did she not like it because it makes her feel bad or did she not like because she prefers flavor you know what that's a good point because some people like when like waterslides like that because it tastes like one something like I don't like water because it don't taste like sugar or anything is  as in it let me tell you something man I to Hot Yoga I do it a couple days a week I do know I need 90 minute classes and water is delicious I agree when you are sweating and it's a hundred five degrees in that room you're holding these poses and sweat is dripping off your for it and you got a 64-ounce jug what it does to fill with ice and water you want that water if you could be a Diet Coke or a fucking glass of milk I wouldn't touch those things don't go right for that water when I'm when I'm done I ever job for my error I remember  Pig going from only tell you got water was in a water fountain water faucet water hose yeah nobody had bottled water when this started my mother thought it was a devil when I started charging motherfuckers who water how's it going when they started trying to be water my mother was like  no ain't no I could go right home and get water and I saw it go from charge it like a McDonald's like they like like extra for water I started I saw the change from that to bottling and have it a tag saying 99 Cents for a bottle of water yeah when you pair for the bottled all right the water but whatever it is stop having bottled water in the studio like it's almost so many people have complained and they're all right everyone's right I listen to the good plan my guy I got other things to think about  but do I what can we figure do about that we're done producing Darnell's podcast can we figure out a bottle water is this is just a bring the conundrum into a good full Place could measure math fellow go back over there every time is going to waste more water potentially than this he's up to my waist what do you want for the working process that works for Dick Cheney what we're thinking like a glass bottle yeah  Frost person that comes in is that bad how big buzzword brother I mean we couldn't them clean them after every show we have a giant jug and fill up a glass bottle so is that important people what about if people know you're recycling does that make a difference makes me feel like a better person if they know you're recycling but what makes me feel like a better person if they think I'm a better person I'm like again some people just never gonna give a fuck about plastic I'm one of them off of whatever parts  you can bury say you can show me the animals and turtles whatever the fuck about plastic I want to go back to the hot yoga I love it I did it today 90 minutes we just want to go back to that because the idea of how water tastes and I want to it's goes back to me look this way who's this guy oh that's Brody Stevens he killed himself okay great dude it's not me  information I was going back to the idea of water yeah taste and good right and as well as any type of food and drink right all that taste better after hard work yes so after you do on your hot yoga and you sweaty and you put that hard-working now you understand you appreciate the water yes so what I teach my children right is hard work when Adam when the most high told Adam he said man shall work to the  the sweat of his brow now we may have a job that don't make us sweat you know I but if you ain't working out or doing something physical to make your body physically your own the reward of working out which is the nutrients that you have to replenish yeah after you have burnt them out you know I mean then you're not going to ever taste water you ain't gonna be able to bite into a piece of celery and like and feel it that's right  no you don't think I respect I know you'll think I said no a job selling say what you just said I know that's the only thing that you won't get that burst it is not like you get some celery that got that motherfucker pot with no strings or nothing attached to it just a clear bite so I know you and I know you looked at me again but the water this inside salary I know you'll think I respect that I respect and she likes our route peanut butter I like celery with anything like celery pepper I could just eat it  like I could just eat celery I like celery peanut butter like celery with hummus you know I know how good a peach taste what you think you're right celery if you lift weights and then you eat a peach or juicy cold Peach you bite into that fucking thing and it's not a sexual reference to Mike but you said it don't help each rupee you said it you said you gotta do something and your life to appreciate right some people that's drinking right like you you don't know maybe I like you  I'm not saying right now I'm not gonna do this with you I'm not doing this for both we will keep your secret if you're talking about being nice early as positive be nice but both drinking I'm drinking to something has to like you've been drinking like the best time you appreciate water is at night after heavy drinking like you've been giving you your Palace in the desert alcohol alcohol you you had that feeling where you had some drinks one night the next day you drink some ice cold water you like goddamn  who the fuck is in a disk simple it's a simple it's the same thing right your body was like asking for asking for your right but when you're drunk and you're drinking that water you feel like an asshole like God what the fuck I do with my brother I can do this with one glass of water yeah the average  the fuck is drinking they don't give a fuck about that ratio a buddy of mine drank with Jean-Claude Van Damme back in the day professional John Claude Van Damme was a pro he said he would have a drink and he brought a gallon of water weighs exactly a gallon so he would have a drink and then bam big fucking child water that's the only way he rolled just kept running the bathroom taking a piss and coming right back when he drank he drank with a gallon of water and whatever the fuck he was throwing down that's a Bluefish now  I'm actually probably in the top 10 Master drinkers Wow have you ever if you ever really want to get a crazy night of drinking and see if you can hang time now just put his glass down and it just but but you know so that's that's that's that's a challenge anybody who ever catch me on the right they want to challenge me but my brother divorce is something that's really cool about drinking smoking and everything right because at one point you know all hip-hop  I'm abusing it right I'm just you know just whatever yo Bonk Bonk Bonk Bonk Bonk he says listen God he said listen y'all getting high y'all drinking for nothing no celebration you did he said used you drink after you complete something and then you celebrate nigga  to give myself a reason yes yep you know I'm and I have reason to celebrate yeah we give yourself that's a beautiful Philosophy for Life give yourself a reason to celebrate you know you do really yes you do what are you celebrating we celebrate celebrate this so many people that are fan of yours spill over to fans of mines and I get so many  we saying when are you going to go on The Joe Rogan so let's celebrate that and that's what we're celebrating today I mean I've been I've been hearing about you reading about you listening to you and my friends and my peers for some years now and I mean it is your first time on the show but listen to me that's an honor because me I've been listening to music forever and so I appreciate you guys tremendously obvious so for you to be here 16 don't test that will tell you that your collaboration  with Rage Against the Machine Wu Tang Clan Ain't Nothing to fuck with is the greatest collaboration and all of rap rock that looks second place maybe Run DMC and Aerosmith but to me my generation Rage Against the Machine and Wu Tang Clan Ain't Nothing to fuck with is the ultimate workout can I have a blue truck driver won't fucking song man if you're doing deadlifts and that song Wu-Tang tiger style you'll hear tamburello guitar you're ready to lift I got one Wu-Tang question  was Wu-Tang sorry I like the way you start the quest of this shit you did me this is you should like this and your syllabus syllable that shit was yo look okay okay okay let me see Wu-Tang the vision ended the design of Wu-Tang was it designed to fall apart and when I say fall apart was it designed  I mean we're a group of individuals that were getting that equal due respect needed a bigger platform so everybody see me at one time  who did you get that yeah all the members and the reason the reason why I say this years ago years ago years ago years ago I had a sketch group years ago he is glad to schedule it was 12 motherfuckers everybody had different personalities everybody was dope everybody could be a started different right whatever but nobody had to plan to get the people to see that everybody is nice right no but I was  this right Wu-Tang was designed like to come together for a common cause right and that cause of course being to express our art to rise ourselves out of poverty in the feed our families so that was that was a foundation but it's not designed to fall apart in fact Wu-Tang that's why on our second album is called Wu-Tang forever right meaning no matter what we do no matter if I go make movies or Method Man make movies or you got right boy  look you come back together yeah we always got to come out with this what I have to do during this forever but hold on with this last night but now to put us all on the same like to expose it all to the world through one Outlet yes me that it had to had to be there yeah it had to be that and the reason why I said it because I had my sketch group I my schedule years ago it's called secret society when I was doing remember that I had this manager and she came this was before today Chappelle Show everything I was like I'm doing jokes about watching you bro look and I'm and then I said I said I'm one of the managers working with she was like  the name of our group was sick Society she said I had my caps I had marked their bright red grass about my father and she said Daniel I think Secret side is falling apart I said nigga it was supposed to fall apart it was supposed to fall apart but with his fault with his fault does it lands to where you can grow something else like I knew it was only three people that were going to be stars but it was for other people that were going to be writers write write it was two other enough motherfucker that was going to be it was different shit but we needed dad okay  I got you an are so dumb so fall so fall apart that worm you said fall apart I didn't mean to neglect it like you make more like spread his wings spread his wings yeah and like even though like when I said that mean it like even though like everybody for the most part everybody want to be a superstar everybody had the chops everybody wasn't a superstar right and it's proven to this day some people like this guess what this is my fucking wrote on eight different shows we won right this dude is toured in Europe we want zactly you know I'm saying it was like when I say fall apart  like it was going to go to here and then it was just going to be like it fall like this yo-yo it was good we all got it now so that the strong enough could they exist because exist independently in different areas but always come back together if they're not to everyone that's why we called ourselves like Wu-Tang forms like Voltron so we watch Voltron yes yes it's of the Lions because for hello yeah go fuck some shit up but when you need the Blazing Sword everybody got to come together yeah boats are so so we took that philosophy  yeah and we knew that within all of our crew that any one of us was first of all Wu-Tang as a bunch of Alphas what it wasn't like what right it wasn't a soccer dude I know geez it fit but you only want to get to Jesus  Zev jails it'd be like come on say you already know what you know cause I think it's that big a way to 30 30 days for it double up on it belt 90's Night the 90s baggy right yes yeah yeah we know back in those days when you might have won three pair of pants right yeah and a summer yeah but not but the Mac but the main thing is that the be able to you know I made to to have the alpha energy right and then come to a to us and to our industry  that was lacking that Alpha energy I know I was a mystical philosophy behind it to course that was the thing about it is like Wu-Tang was inexorably connected to Kung Fu right like there was like there was that's the wool yeah it did the ancient Chinese kind of philosophy was a part of the music man it was like there was a thing about you guys that you were spiritual there was like a there was an intelligent and then of course you had ODB who is off the rails  this was beautiful about it is that you you guys all existed together you know what I'm saying and again even though you had this sort of spiritual kongfu kind of energy to it you also had people just off the rails partying but it can be wild New York has used to have a fucking Wu Tang sightings in new wouldn't even know Hooper's in there that was her who like  that anybody from Wu-Tang was here it was a whole bunch of not would say motherfuckers get a lot of pussy yeah just got here  don't take it out on God would watch or as the fake cappadonna oh my God he didn't get caught to you till you got about 70 grand or something like we was that in Baltimore look Atlanta but he does it at all it just went out because you didn't because someone is so many of us you might not know how motherfucker look yo you not gonna know when they start getting it did you think about the design rules are doing but they did they woke at kids who got kids that is like we at the point  now I'm old school whoo kids got trying to have kids should I do it baby wolves oh my God what the most the most beautiful thing though you know that's the beauty of art creativity and and being you know the spiritual aspect of the alpha aspect all these aspects multiplied us to be a unique version of the American dream and when you look at you know we did the documentary of Mike  made on Showtime you can see that that it's more like it's like the Lotus Leaf grows out of mud right but it's a symbol of Buddhism which is all this peace and Beauty but it grows out of mud we like that which grew out of the mud and then when you go and watch our Hulu service the American Saga right you get to see like this group of men weren't always on the same page wasn't always there's no way trains with each other and I think the biggest thing  that I learned about putting the TV show on Hulu is that this other kids Across America in a similar situation yes right so so there's a scene where this is my character it's the soundtrack to life right but I just down talking about like there's this in the kids are hearing this that they can resonate this makes sense on limited right so yeah so the get my first drum machine I have to you know get it by illegal means right and think about how  Arizona but think about how many people think about how many people you know need something to do something but don't have the means to get it and some may cross the line you know at the end of the day the way I really got my equipment right you know I definitely try to do anyway to get it but I didn't get it by stealing it right I had the hustle let's do one of you don't you want it you didn't just want to get it for say I got you one it because you wanted to do something with use it right is that that's a difference I sold Apple  those oranges we lose papers socks I'm on one of those socks guys have you been in New York back in the day sucks Nipsey Hussle was the sock smell you see dude walk around selling socks you are the fuck knows anybody by the way you said it yeah he was yo whatever your bomb down on 25th Street you get maybe you can get a dozen for 30 bucks right there you can sell them at 10 hours  so you get a dozen packs for 30 bucks with six in a pack you go uptown right and you sell them for $10 just for the whole package but you got to find a neighborhood that need socks you just can't go in there buddy got a lot of socks but anybody says you can't say yeah but most people  close high-end clothes no no you go uptown to get know you get you get drugs from Uptown oh drugs like although I could get a her house a hundred hours before drugs Uptown bring it back downtown selling for $200 yeah it's just like the best race or any drug you ever night but then when you go buy drugs thank you goodbye  ounce Uptown right and sell it downtown or even take it back to Staten Island you going to Triple your money Trip easy easy that's so sad Islands three you can use like up with your money like the villages to you like that okay if you go out of state you may file scripts and that's what all the New York mother fucker was coming down to DC and Virginia exactly but socks You by downtown and take it out town because the drug bill is a flighty gonna have please  talking about the socks with $10 that you pay five dollars that was my hus remember the new Urban boys remember they had VHS tapes of people sit in the back of the movie theater and film the movie and make a VHS that they'd set up all yeah quarter the own worse the worst bootlegging shit heavy but if you but then that's when VCR just came in so it didn't matter the quality you just had to have something  put in the fucking new technology yeah you know what you know what art form of whatever supports new technology always deal with porno whenever when your son true it's true well there's a new Weathers from beta to VHS to CD it's porno that gets people to buy explore the new technology pave the way that paved the way I don't know the yeah because there's so many people  people are jerking off there's just it's an unknown satisfiable quantity that you can't you always can count on them people always going to jerk off to porn so how do you get it to them quicker how'd you get it to him we're gonna make some money rewinding to like CD to Alik to now all you need is tag words they just really important to me the way we think about people stealing music or people stealing comedy like they think about stealing porn so if you go to certain sites which is free and you just watch porn  apparently the people that make it they don't get a piece of that so someone's making a ton of money and the other people stealing so you say we make don't know that go shit too much of a pussy is wide open this is like I'm just saying it's a commodity it's a thing just like a joey if you create something ask like if it's legal if you leave  well if it's legal rather and you hire cameraman you pay an actor you pay an actress you let him fuck you give them a certain amount you film it and then that's yours and then someone takes that and then they put it up on their website and then you could watch it for free and they sell advertising space and they make money off to be better lawyers didn't buy it at all is infringing yeah it's no different than if they downloaded a Wu-Tang album and then they started selling it they put it for they put it on a website and then put ads  to that Wu-Tang out so then that means they need to get better lawyers can wait he's a better story happen but not you guys with that one album that that that drug pharmacy dude Martin which is named boscorelli shkreli he actually got a hold of one of your outfits an unreleased Wu-Tang I heard it was real them the streets it was to hear what is the reality we have to plan what about the reality of it is that it's now sitting in a  temperature control room and the Department of Justice really so it's his he owns it still well he's you know he's a he's incarcerated right right right right and sold sold I think a lot of its assets has been seized by the government and including that album so those songs have never been released but if we say one thing about look at that fucking thing yeah is that beautiful or what that guy's got to be bro that's your wicked by that off him for real how does it down  look right here nope with that look it'll be beautiful I have but I would release that online or release it with you or let you really are by it made for freedom I don't give a fuck whatever you want but that the sitting there makes no sense to me and that box looks dope and I know that guys in jail you figure out a way to get out of work holler at your boy you know what that's how you right there I tell you what the dope right here though it would I tell you one thing hmm I did have a conversation with the  gentleman right with Martin yeah I said listen y'all because he had a you know you had a lot of bad things going on phone I said yo if I was you I would take this chance to do philanthropy and I would give this away to the public if I was him yes a store on how much he had talking from the public yeah but he was in that like we talked about earlier he wasn't a nice person he didn't want to give the impression it was a nice person he wanted to be I don't give a fuck what did you say was too he was having too much fun son right  just too much like whatever bitch fuck your I got this white box but you know what I don't think you understood consequences I think he was doing that no proof he was he thought look he's a kid was he born into money know what do you make us money know he'd made his money and pharmaceutical in his head he was here he was immigrant parents who was like janitors but he wasn't like born to this company no so he was a part of the company he's got a gun but I think one thing that he had two nationally more than anything oh okay  but we said we never experienced the public eye like he did with this whole pharmaceutical crisis where he's overcharging for was AIDS medication so it was probably did but I think that his point he wanted he wanted to be known as that guy he was a he was a smart dude he want to be known as that got he didn't he didn't mind being a supervillain just put it down yeah he and Luther right he didn't want to be on a low making money trying to be on the podcast he reached out to me yeah that would've been interesting but I did tell her  mm just yeah whatever sense of us but I did tell him I mean me I'm a type of person I'm always going to try to see some advice in a positive form right that's just my personality I listen bro they talking shit about you in the world you don't look good for you Wu-Tang is good I told him who turns ever yeah I say if I was you I'll take this opportunity to do something good how about this how about this maybe he sells me the box and then we release the the music  I'll buy the whole thing from him and then we'll release it I don't know dude I don't know if he's got it he wants to sell it the way he wants to sell it he's he's he's just lost his appeal so oh the thing and you sell shit while you're in jail and you play Monopoly Monopoly don't you do that  it's hardly used to be like I want a house no no it's just me crazy do that how many songs like 25 so that is ridiculous I think me personally needs to be released I think I don't my personal opinion  nobody in the history of music has been able to make  an idea or sodas never heard art art like right to be quite honest it might only be no motherfucking songs in there you think he knows  and you said it up for people to be critical of it can kind of give their opinion the opinion is there was something so dope did we could just break it down to one in the fucking like what was the thought process but a quote for from our point of view right it was just like that was how I you know from my point of view music was being devalued right by streaming services Law Society right well how how so  don't do streaming of course right illegal downloading illegal downloads right if you want to let's talk a little bit of business I won't go to give me 2 minutes of business all right so let's just take naps the right okay who's the founder of this type of Technology right and he takes millions of songs and gives them away and then now people are getting all these songs for free now the music industry like any other industry has a certain quota of business it does every year like every other industry right whether it's four billion dollars a year five billion dollars  you is the industry of a group of people and that's their yearly quota so of Napster comes right and and and he takes all these songs where all these people who are waiting for their publishing checks waiting for the economics would be created from music now there's no publishing check all the numbers are now and decrease because there's no physical cell of their music for us to accumulate a value the send you a check but then at the end of the day after he does that  he gets a billion dollars so now you took and what belongs to this they say there's a thousand artist that's worth value and far as you know that sell records that you could say accumulate money right so we took we took the power of a thousand and put it in one man's hand okay so that's one of the first mistakes as an industry we make and then a second mistake we make is that now their services going and there's illegal downloads and people won't pay  a dollar for the record right right and for album you going to pay 10 to 12 hours for album even this a it was $20 you won't pay that but you'll pay 300 $400 for your headphones to $3 for your iPod or your phone and you using it for music let me ask you this what's that fast without your headphones without music your headphones is useless right so why would you not pay the 10 20 hours for the music because they don't have  of to right right because they don't get it some other way but let me ask you this what is the best way to support artists what's the best way to buy it well the best way to buy it now I mean no yeah yeah yeah oh no now your music well now 10 Clan anybody's music what's the best way to get the most out of it what the best way in the past was physical but now the industry has figured out how to monetize the Digital streaming so now things are starting to rebalance but during this period of time though maybe within the last three four years it's starting to be balanced but  you look at from 2000 to 2015 there's a total unbalanced and a lot of artists had to stop making music because there's no economics right there are group like the Wu-Tang Clan right so this is say this is say the average various for a whoo rapper you know let's say you'll remember let me get it let me get 16 he might be yeah until he don't know what 16 is 2 yeah 669 for that  right okay 20,000 joke okay so now let's just say he got ten verses on this album you know I'm a let's say every other woman will do the same so to get the guitar album made it may cost a million dollars a studio session a studio session is up to let's say at a cheapest level a hundred bucks an hour you do what you do a 12-hour block out that's another grand a day just to get into the studio but you got to engineer then you got so it costs money  to create music right but now you get all this done and you want to sell it and somebody just the world just takes it for free so now you can't we create it again now even though the tools of God easier now and you could do a lot with your laptop and all that even a laptop is to geez bro even though the download test logic right which everybody you $200 man and so you need a socially so so it's merchandise and brand now it's merchandise and  brand is merchandise and being entertained the idea of that Branch if you're a fan but if you're a fan what's the best way to support their out when there are you what's the best way to support Wu-Tang Clan what's the best way to support is it Apple music like what is the best wine iTunes know that you know now everything is found this way other words if you can streaming's good you can stream it spotify's good modifies good you could download it directly to your phone if you are if you cannot give prescriptions to fans like what's the best way to support Wu-Tang Clan what's the best way to accumulate  music require music I mean if I just put it in there all good now like streaming yeah biggest bounce I miss like the tunes I was just Amazon look music is the second thing the Catch-22 here Joe is this okay now music is also made to be hugged yes so while one point I try to prove a point by saying look I'm gonna put a value on it so you know there's a value to it but there's a value to me but then on the other point right we put I put another album out called a better tomorrow which is like yo do what you want  with that you're not come because I don't make music for me to listen to I make it for the world and listen to it with the same time so the best way to support your artist is just by listening to the music I come with you it's beautiful but so this is good though this is because I've always wanted to know this because I've always I've always been like what do I do do I do iTunes do I do Amazon like where do you get the most money back from yeah I think look I think they did the system has found the way to embarrass ourselves okay so it's okay now yeah so Spotify is  Slimmer you know streaming look you know I mean I think even tell us with is thinking about coming over to the streaming thing that dirty girl everybody's don't come to the stream and share because because because that's the way the listen now as long as she gets a good deal right don't be like you said just to hold things in the day is play fair yes like you know what you can say I don't want this streaming service but somebody has to have a platform for people to even come check for you yes a hundred percent but you need to know fancy know what what if I'm a fan  and it might you know $14 is not too much money for me to spend I need to know where to spend it with if I could if there's one place you could tell me that's the best way to support Wu-Tang Clan this is the best proposal fair right it was a fan and I had the money to spend you know I would definitely you know I would buy the vinylright why because it's tangible right by our spending money right okay you got a physical object physical for physical especially if  record Like You by the vinyl it is it is so funny that you say that because I know people of certain blah blah blah blah is like this oh shit they want audio rights to something so taking put it on vinyl and then the value is the history the story like a motherfucker one of vinyl Wu-Tang because it's art just like will do enjoy it's alright and like you said we talked about it earlier it's  coming back yeah it's coming back not now I'm not saying it's gonna go to clubs or anything like that in a DJ's like that but the act of collecting something and take it take home with you some tears receipt member CDs CDs is like this technology is about to die why would I buy this city because it has a booklet member yeah it's all good you can picture weed on it  did you bring your feet up the TV truckers oh shit I got this bamboo they give you a giant piece of rolling paper yeah and that was the last thing and I don't see what you did but I don't see people doing that but I think it's going to go back nobody's everybody's not going to Trail hundreds in your house whatever but some people especially if it's a genre or something that you connect with bigamy like I want to buy that well you know what's important though for fans we don't know Uncle P by P for a long time so happy  okay okay now you go talk shit with for a lot of fans they don't know like they don't know what it is no clearly established what's the best way to support an artist like it is it's more great now than ever but like I said if you look the physical act of going somewhere right right and buying something you know it's a give-and-take it's an act like it's like going to a restaurant you go there look the food is  three times the price of cooking at home right but it's a physical act so if you really love an artist right is this like I just got the I paid $100 for the soundtrack to the Once Upon a Time in Hollywood soundtrack $100 yeah it's $100 for the sound was a collector's it was a dead it had like a collector's vinyl okay down at the Grammy Museum I saw it I was like I'm going to take this it some some you know some great songs on it what's the band mm-hmm  they sent a bikini so what's the name of that bad hmm we'll have to go there but anyway point being made a turkey people the Cherokee People Cherokee price Kevin yeah who made that one I don't know yeah who the fuck made that Cherokee people jump what is it Cherokee prize who made that but is it funny but Paul Revere and the Raiders yeah that's it  I said yeah okay well we're here in the latest yeah that's a bold move George Washington the dudes in the boat but point being made is I wanted that vital yes physical thing I wanted a yeah I paid $400 for it right and I walked out the store with it you know I mean yeah it's just like comic books you know I just got a first issue of the new X-Men I actually bought it from F so when I see him I'll give it to him but because he loves comic books and I was in I was in when I was at I say nothing Lois after st. Louis I was in  it was cancerous anyway I was in a view it had a comic book store their what they did and I was like yo they had the first issue of the new X-Men bought that and plastic put that in my bag now of course you could go online and you could do the but the physical tangible thing I think is the best way to support artists and if you are and if you now add a the way audits actually make the most economics is to live concerts so it only way that's going to work is if  Buddy hear your music so I always tell fairs look this listen you know I mean listen enjoy know we creating something for you to understand or for you to fill a Vibe order for me to take you to my location like cash rules everything around me we're taking you back to New York the New York crime side you know and then and then when you come down and you get that song in your DNA and you come to a concert and you see us perform it now we have a symbiotic relationship you got me so that's how I say that's beautiful because you're giving them a  object yeah think it's important I think you're right man that's why I want that goddamn box where are you Martin get out of jail some of that box bitch come on how much do you think he'll sell it for if you had to guess how much he buy it for oh he had it I mean I think they bought it what two million two million but I think I think he had it all he did was he said

call the feds are listening Martin Martin when you getting out I need the box for the desk Martin wow did you  so so wow so now that Donnell is gone I can talk about right now is the best man we finally got him to do a podcast I've shamed him into doing one episode that he already did right because he didn't want to come here and tell me that he hadn't done it yet so he did one and then we're going to take that one Jamie's gonna produce it and edit it it's over this thing is that like we're gonna do it together but will promote it I'll promote it on Instagram I just been trying to get him to do it forever  you know he's a goddamn natural its natural he's a natural he's he makes me cry you can't be stopped now now you said you do hot yoga are you answering said many things in there like what's what's the should is it all physical with yoga for you was it something spiritually no it's what it's a mind cleansing thing as much as it's a physical cleansing thing because it's all about concentrating on my breath and ignoring all the fucking ideas to keep darting in and out of my head it's just like meditation in the sense that I'm trying to  myself down and Center myself and I'm trying to cleanse myself so when I'm holding poses and I'm concentrating on my breathing what it does is it eliminates all of the stuff that I don't necessarily want in my head and allows me to manage my mind better and I think that's the thing that is unmiss understood about yoga because in my opinion and I've done both I've done regular meditation I've done physical exercise I think there's a benefit a great unrecognized benefit to physical meditation and I find that in yoga  Agha I find that martial arts yeah I don't know if you find that as well so definitely yeah because you have you have still meditation fucking stupid lights man we gotta fix it I mean I've been talking about it for three years what happened to the chest son the what the chest oh we got re re being refilled terrifying concoctions so we talk about physical any day meditation right and still meditation so this is say like there's a meditation will you just sit still  you just breathe and actually Wu-Tang right someone give you a little Wu-Tang law so Wu-Tang the story is there's a mark name change Zhang FEI who leaves Shaolin Temple because he feels that the physical exercise is not the proper way to Enlightenment mmm right he thought that the kung-fu was to external right too many complications by ego and so he vetoed so he retreats to to the mountain and he  he goes for internal Kung Fu but in the process of doing internal Kung Fu such as Tai Chi Zen Yi ba Kua right like these techniques like there's there's this thing called the ace piece brocade what you just sit you know I mean and you just do really small movements you first you bang on the back of your ears it's called banging on the heavily drums to open up the back of your brain like if you do that right now if you can't make sense if you cover your ears right  you take the headphones off right and you cover your ears like this you take your thumb like that okay  of course is louder right you here right oh it gives you like a little rhythm right so you do that first right and that's just the open up your your brain like the open that up right you do it why inhale and exhale it bouncing again and yang but that's one of the blow case and it is so he's made these eight pieces of brocade right brocade broke Amy's I got something is blocked right right it's a mom paid right so you want to open it up right open up these open up your  your main vessels you know I mean okay of course being your is your eyes and nose your mouth you know that goes back to Jesus and the seven churches what is the seven churches that Jesus spoke to the seven churches where he spoke to the two hours the two nodes to holding your nose your mouth and into it so he speaking to a man said out of his mouth came a double-edged sword the sword of course no silicon come out of your mouth your tongue is that sword double-edged exactly yeah so it will shots all the preachers to eat pussy we go ahead  right well that would be EP before the kind of league is part of the country before we get to the kind of Legacy so so we'll take itself right this guy leaves the temple go to the mound and meditate and he's dealing with still meditation right but in all reality when you mix it together Wu-Tang is  darling you have the physical and the still meditation and it takes both to actually find this level of Enlightenment you looking for so when bodhidharma came to shall and he actually came from India so bodhidharma was an Indian monk who was more of a yoga student he comes the Shaolin and he's trying to teach them the Indian way but he realized that all the monks were too weak to sit there and they're still meditation and so he created something called the Lohan  hands right on the 18 Lohan's or light and and he these forms and these steps were made so that now they could do a physical movement to build their body up so now they can meditate longer because you have a strong mind what's the use of a strong mind without a strong body and what's the use of a strong body without a strong mind so that's the yin-yang must be balanced and so that's the Shaolin and wudang philosophy so when we met Wu-Tang Clan and I'll go back to myself with this we met Wu-Tang  playing as the name of our crew we took the verse from the Bible about the SS Warden Jesus speaking right we said okay we're going to use our words and our wisdom and I spirituality the talk to the world through our music right but we also took that in the Wu-Tang law they said the Wu-Tang Moss who are monks they developed the best sword style right so we like well we're the Wu-Tang we have the best source now but we come from shalin because that's the the way  well with springs forth right and so we took the physical of shallon as our base the spiritual the meditate force of Wu-Tang and we put it together and and I almost falls off if what you say is true The Shaolin and the Wu-Tang could be dangerous oh my God that's that's hip-hop history ladies and gentlemen I need a would I need a woo names yo give me a root  well I'll be I don't know I gotta you gotta you gotta go to that Dave's iterator sir yo you have your name generate me know how do you do it you can't change who you are the words won't change your essence I just want to your essence is Donnell Rawlings this is no escaping that Joe I respect what you're saying right now I respect that and you said very white right now  Kevin Smith  and I just was doing these bars and at the end of every one I said Wu-Tang at the end of every one I said we'll take and Kevin Smith know me he every time I text him he's like Wu-Tang forever Dave says that shit I'll tell you this is what this rap pitch to him for the Halloween show like they know every time I write is like you don't think it will take forever what Wu-Tang forever so we had I had pictured scene where all I'm saying is Wu-Tang Wu-Tang and I'm in a dispensary right  do you know how to hit a sixer security cams it should I believe me like an aunt who was it and my folks say it's Wu-Tang no actual Wu-Tang show up to the weed spot and that's the thing I punctuated all my raps with aw shit you know you know what they they they did have a lot of jokes with Wu-Tang it right and I really appreciate I love her music yeah beautiful Manhattan on the show but he did one Wu-Tang joke right that that fucked me up what was it  so watch it it's so you did it three Netflix specials but it was the first one and so they my wife be excited yo Dave only put it on and he watching it and we dying laughing and then he he goes into the the scene where he does like he's at a party and he had the transgender do fall out and all that and everything and then he then he goes you know he don't understand you know how you know how somebody do that like you know I mean like what does somebody do it is just you know did this chopped  a dick off Wu-Tang bang they just keep going I was like what what the fuck was that  I'm somewhere and meeting an elevator and boom it hits me because the state of my fucking mind right I fucking start dying laughing what was punctuated no no what was so what was the difference with what you thought the joke did you didn't get but what made you get it well maybe get it was just the I'm trying to because Davis is Davis a genius you all right his shit is crazy all right it's like a lyric you're going to get the line when you get the rhyme right right so what he was saying he said he don't understand how  how a man chop his dick off so what a man do a man just goes as smooth can change how the reason the time with you guys what I got was the most gangster phrase you could say that describes the hardest shit you could do like is Wu-Tang yes cut your dick off that's beef now  as did this shit exactly hold on what is that it so now those what it was did it who don't know so there's a little there's a dude that was affiliated with what that's right don't say affiliate before he was a Wu-Tang he was Wu-Tang sake hold on listen I wasn't part of the Wu-Tang Clan all right Claire all right hold on I got to give you a test before we go further I don't want to test I agree with you I found this from The Shaolin Wu-Tang Clan strikes again the Riza the judges are  Ol Dirty Bastard inspectah deck Raekwon the chef u-god okay Ghostface Killah and let them breath important Master killed in combat the matter make wander in New York right now for the jets-giants game yeah so called cappadonna and last the Killer and a lot mathematics and sometimes even Redman the street life but but check it out but this Soul so we had other Goose resign Northstar I actually sang Northstar assigned the Black Knights  both west coast groups actually so awesome I'm from Long Beach some from Compton you know and you know made a lot of songs with them talented young brothers so one of the members of the North Star zoned out he's zoned out on Stone doubt many of them drugs you talk sold out  and they called when you do it I don't what they call it  yeah there's a word for adults what's it what's the word when you do it castrate your says she had to get the worried well yeah okay so now there's also he casters itself right so now that's the punchline of his joke the perseid is like because this dude for no reason it was a callback yeah you got it in an elevator yeah I'll just walk  it's a lame I'll say is yeah it's like 24 hours later oh my God that bit as a long fuse yes yeah but Dave Dave does got those kind of job man I remember where we want to roll when that actually was the news right and he was like Wu-Tang punctuated so much in anything whatever you do for fun anywhere for anything Wu-Tang forever yeah so when a member or at least an Affiliated members  of the Wu-Tang cuts off his dick and yeah he doesn't think he could have been he'll do what he could have been like a nephew of whew whew it includes having our own nephew or whatever you know what's so crazy about that incident Photon that incident was very hurtful you know like you know it's yeah but it was hopeful in a sense like when it happened I wasn't I was doing a TV show called gang-related right and so you know like I would go like say it happened on the night it happened the next night is a cache where all the whole cow  get together and this shit is the news this is like when every Network Debbie TMZ this is like oh shit and I'll come in the room and I was like what the fuck happened like you know I mean yeah but I'ma tell you thing about is like I don't know what you need to do to represent your gangster but kind of your dick off is the most go hard shit a motherfucking could it's hard right now you get that's like next level there's Next Level now homie so so I had a buddy with me at the time Paul Banks from Interpol and was working on the album and and so he saw me is like them damn Bobby you look kind of  fucking the Press I said oh man like I don't like the way this is shit sound man right it's like you know I mean it is like the press it feels you know feel like that's the first of all I don't think I found in the history of me my study I never heard of a man chopping his own shit off this shit is biblical and we said  what he said he's listening he probably was really fucked up problem right it's like that he's probably really fucked up yeah I said but then you know I'm saying they say he jumped out the window out of a two-story he jumped over the balcony of a two-story apartment building but did I did it go they say he tell Tico  no no no no no she said this he said  I think he was sober when he jumped  how can you get there check it out he said I thank he was sober when he jumped and he went on to give me this whole story about one of his friends that would had a problems right here because he had a console me right now I'm kind of puzzled so he's like trying to fucked up he's trying to control me he told me I said yeah but he didn't die he said yeah he didn't die because he wasn't going to die like you know I'm a so gave me a little metaphor my head so he said I had a friend who used to drink and shit and one night he  a problem with he one night he was in the hotel and he laid on a fucking the balcony of a window right and it said and I still get the fuck off that in the windows over said he fought this way he's going down since story but if you go this way this Hit the Floor he's in the room and that's the that's the whole thing he said that  he went this way  he went out every ten stores and stories but during the fall he sobered up but when he hit the ground he didn't die he became quadriplegic the dick cut off by the fuck no no no listen to this the this the alcohol do that starting point being made is that you ain't gonna go in till it's time to go right I'll wind it was so you think you kill yourself it ain't half but if you cut your dick off and you survive that that's the time to go hold on hold on but  so the idea is was he sober when he jumped and so and I had the chance to speak to him right I sent them a Quran you know I mean I was like I think you know you might have to get into some studies brother cuz you know it's so so so so anyway sending the Quran I hold you down off of that and then I said that's let me ask you a question  and the question was you know did you know when you jump you know what you say yeah he's like for that moment like it was everything else was whatever it was and you know you can read his story and he says why he says what happened in the story but when he jumped he that was a moment of sobriety and and for me that was like that's the way jump when he cut his dick off there wasn't a moment of sobriety it's after okay you know you ever do some shit you ever been fucked up yeah you do some shit at all oh  like I had a really bad sexual thing mad mad was one of the sex nights and I was I was I was but up I kind of I kind of had like a blanket over me and he's going to room to room fucking girls looks like it was one of them like bad sex drug in your system I'm fucking everybody tonight right  but then there's that moment like oh shit I fucked up right I know I fucked up right and you and you get sober for about 30 seconds  and then the hawk it back as you go knock another where those loads went anyway yeah anyway that's my that's that's it but so he jumping but didn't Igloo is Dick back on I stitched it back on right did I me it fixed it's all good bro if that's you yeah I stopped following the story after that and it's good that was at the  thank God for scientists thank God for a miracle world that minutes and that was like forever will be the most gangster shit you can do okay stop your dick of a say Wu-Tang that's do they should probably say that because he's gonna film it now they gotta World start hoping the Dave season so I'm getting I'm getting the track today I'm getting attracted a getting a track and you

interested in the Hulu show okay cool I'ma do that yeah this one thing so it's I'm give you some added to that's why I was just now we're good he's good Tim's gonna beep over okay so descriptions email people mad right now what the fuck it was better when it was alive  live I could send him a picture of my dick so the Hulu show was are created by me my partner Alex see executive producer Brian Grazer and I love Brian yeah and that he was just here last week oh yeah yeah he's all right that's why he's an interesting guy man very very I really like talking to him and he well he's he's he's a entertainment icon and genius what'd he do and he had a he actually read my book The Dow with  and that led to him have an interest in making this into a TV series you know I me and we're so we are partnered with Alex see Fran seek out counsel and we vote 10 episodes of this we don't you know got a writers room put it on Hulu is called Wu-Tang in the American Saga an American Saga and it follows us you know pre tag days it obvious  polity right so you get to see some of the things that happen in our neighborhoods and some of the things that motivate us to the men that we became and it's not only because of like like you know we know we have the Liberty to fictionalize some things right so for instance they could be a character you know you think about every Ghana right that's like popular over the last three to five years right maybe a little longer right but for us that say they happened when we was kids in our neighborhood  and the same neighborhood mind you of course okay so that's it happened on Staten Island you know I mean and and and we was able to do the show kind of go back and look at some of the same problems that we have as American citizens in our communities that we're still facing today for instance in episode 3 one of my favorite episodes you see a black mother addressing a funeral  about how so many of these kids are dying from gun violence over things that's not even valuable things that could be the place where the sneakers are gold chain but the life can't be replaced and she goes on to say something that you know as a mother the pain of Labor you hear how painful that is right I seen how painfully so imagine the pain a woman feels when their child is killed in Cold Blood I can't even imagine it and she goes  to say we never see our children as  these gangsters you know criminals we see them as our babies you know I mean and we're turning our community into a war zone and we got to realize that this is our community and these are our babies so the saw the show gets a chance to tap into all that because these things happen and I was talking about earlier with so much the same thing yeah when I was like a black person perspective and their views and had a look at  just totally different from someone that grew around with the NRA was strong with grow around with ahead gun laws I'm saying what happens if I press when you think about a gun you think about something that's could take somebody's life yeah you know I'm saying that not only that you also think about a gun in certain cases with took a life of somebody was innocent it was somebody with an authority you know I'm saying so like most black people their connection with guns is totally different from just like hunting and I want to protect my household yeah  yeah because and and I'll show we know we tap into that but at the same time we also tap into that feeling when when the kid gets a new drum machine right without their instruction manual and he's gonna stay up all night trying to figure it out you know I made a play on it and make something eventually make something you know like for the case of me that SP 1200 I made that beat for bring the pain which is one of Method Man's first video is one of this phone  chart and songs and you did take the think about me trying to figure this thing out and figure it out and then make some getting excited every time you figure it out and it's and they make something that the world appreciates my so you get that that angle as well but then you also you know you get you know at the time my mother was working for a man a fat Larry if that Lobby was a Echelon cousin to know you got to know the guy who ran the number spot  it's on Staten Island you know I got to tell you restaurant I can't remember it was so difficult so illegal and fucked up it was so good that now yeah it was like oh shit I ain't nobody out here yeah so sweet so sweet to that culture as well so so anyway so it was an honor to work with imagined TV you know Brian Grazer of art Howard also blessed us on it as well and my partner Alex see who just a good way  he bought Superfly right the new Super Fly and he says a good writer in our partnership led to these episodes and it's a vegetable right man filled to be respected as a hip-hop Pioneer is someone is started some different shit in like you could Rock a Wu-Tang with forever but you still been able to like be identified like you you don't say how's it feel to be go through the Hip Hop thing and didn't being  respected in the film World in a right world like you are now I'm it's a blessing course right you can say that without no joke no strings attached that wasn't a joke just in the beauty of it all for me for the Riza is that every step that I take and I mean footprint I leave I leave the for hip-hop right so you think about you know of course you know dr. Dre is in front of me he's ahead of me you know and so you know I  this records before I had a record and so I watched the NWA movie and I'm like wow it's a movie though it was an album that was a movie and now you know how do I take it to another level well now it's not a movie it's a TV series wow you see and now somebody else in hip-hop could take a look at that and they can say wow what can we do now to take it to another level so the biggest blessing for me the biggest reward is knowing that there's Footprints being  left by the Abbot if they called me to admit but the Abbot is leaving Footprints so and showing people in hip-hop you don't have to be crabs in a barrel or trying to say around or trying to make a beat I mean you could you could you know you could take your heart and put it in many forms because there's many Outlets of art even an editor this many oh yeah even a good editor hip-hop video editor it's a certain style to his edited by so because he has a he has the  capital u Army so even there is an outlet a lot of young people you know in many fields we all sometimes strive towards the same goal not realizing how many people would takes to achieve the goal and do Ferrum and with this new film being one of the most collaborative art forms is if you watch a movie you'll see you know hundreds of names go by when I did my movie Man with the Iron Fists I had was that Tarantino yeah yeah yo  you know the weird thing about it like man like me being on the outside and saying Ukraine anything man that connection felt so like it was suppose it made so much sense and it made so it's like duh and the baddest man alive is like number two Behind The Rage Against the Machine Wu-Tang collaboration a keys God damn that's a good song before I goddamn well thank you my point being made that 500 people  employee yeah a lot of people a lot of moving Parts it's what think about the young people out there who's trying to figure out whether they aren't feeling fit in with their talent fit in and I say to them look it took 500 people to make that okay and you never know where your talent going to fall so be good like he told you to spit the spit 16 you gotta spit 16 no no he got us backstage but here but his no no listen his talking  attract Millions just like 16 yo man only reason I only reason this is why I want him to spend 16 because knew he was going to say where's the fuck is your pockets right I was like this before he gets he was Defensive already know this motherfuckers voice is the voice of this whole shit in a motherfucking to could just sit there and talk to somebody forever and not only just talks about ever guess after  doing comedy I was economy did not got time to talk to somebody forever and I'll have to talk about nothing should ideally as like that's some crazy you can do it too I want y'all started 44 minutes with nobody you I got to produces y'all every said it's time I put you three producers we gonna do it yeah you're on the road man you got no worries yeah where's it going to leave with a verse oh crap hit me with it what's the logistics is my egotistic personality part of my coexistence or is it just  dangerous stranger paying me Uninvited visit like an unwanted Christmas guests or is it just a fragment of my lower self Envy greed and lust or my higher self good will love and trust is this therapy to on therapeutic to discuss I was dangling in the dirt like a pale loose shoe strings but I was born in the USA by Bruce Springsteen Torn Between the temptation of bringing the Ruckus to maintaining the structure the keeping girls on my payroll that it cuts your nuts off after they  fuck you before you rupture they try to put me in a quiet place with the word stop or put me in a clothespin space through in life through a bird box but close the windows shut the doors scattered out on the floor so the sound of my footsteps are dampen and absorb that's the metaphor to kill the noise while they walk around we look blindfolded as they kill our boys and these crazy race is wrong with cold steel and they killed for Joy plus bills inside the church and outside the shopping store inside the movie theater school campus and church  the synagogue's no location is omitted most cases get acquitted by mental illness and no guns are prohibited is it rational to think this is a national problem therefore is a threat to National Security and the National Guard's needs to solve it or is it visible it's a problem or individuals who are not in quarter with the principle of one nation under God indivisible respect my veterans ladies and gentlemen that's it that's it  that's the way a fucking podcast who an honor sir thank you thank you bye everybody come on folks that was fun right that was

did record a new one right now shopping it around he's awesome I love him give it up for Greg Fitzsimmons  The Joe Rogan Experience Train by day Joe Rogan podcast by night all day  Gregory Joseph sober October is over but we can we were allowed to smoke cigars during silver October for whatever reason but they do get you high they do give you a nice little buzz they do yeah it's weird that that's like thought of as being a sobriety thing that you need is it really I mean if you're smoking people smoke cigarettes when they're sober yeah all those fucking a guys right those guys were always  these guys are those guys will tell you you can't have a non-alcoholic beer which I do I haven't done a I've even had a drink it'll be fucking 30 years next month that I haven't had a drink didn't you have like one or two when we need I may need I had some Scotch that's a weird one right I had like  I didn't get drunk but I had like a few shots did you like feel weird about that I've been all those years  I think I felt so weird about him being dead that the whole thing felt surreal anyway and  I haven't really haven't had the desire I can't say had can't have desire it's more of just like you feel like there's times where you want to just do what everybody else is doing and just chill out and you see everybody getting more mellow and relaxed and social and especially if I'm in a situation where  you know it's a bunch of people I don't know that well maybe it's your kids friends parent kind of situation nice glass of wine to take the edge off dude dude but you did the couple glasses of scotch and then you didn't go right back to it not you became a 21 year old drunk Greg again right  well a lot of us do with my father and he was an alcoholic and I saw  I saw his depression the I the same depression as he does and I felt I felt like when I drank it wasn't always for fun it was a lot of times it was like dealing with feelings and bullshit like that and so I saw him as an unhappy guy who was unfulfilled in a lot of ways and I saw the alcohol was a big part of why his life wasn't but what it could have been right and I just sort of feel like you know maybe maybe I could drink but maybe I can't  why the fuck would it know why fuck with it I'll tell you what man I just got done with a whole month of being sober and then I had my first drink this weekend I feel like shit no kidding polish it real had a couple of glasses of wine went to play pool and I was having a hard time focusing on the ball I was like looking at the balls like three glasses of wine yeah that's all takes three glasses of wine I'm having a hard time seeing right it took like because there were things are all just a little off  it took like an hour for my liver processed it enough where I could play pool well again do you think you just lost your your tolerance tolerance yeah for sure yeah I mean I never never been a big drinker anyway but it was interesting doing sets that's what's always interesting saw like a shot before I go on stage I was like to do a shot of Jack yeah Fargo on say just whoa that's a little wizard for you a little bit of whiskey wow Big Show just one shot yeah  Yang yeah Brian Regan one shot up of Frozen peppermint schnapps before he goes all right peach schnapps it gives you like this Nick yeah but it's not necessary now you know it's definitely not I mean I did a lot of shows this month Stone Cold soba but it's a little weird though The Human Condition that were born with this set of you know this brain and this disease neurological Pathways and this relationship to the universe and the people around us  and that we want to whether it's smoking pot or drinking or taking opiates we want to change the natural state of our brain yeah isn't that fucking weird very weird because it's all we talk about all people talk about do what you ask me dude we got fucked up I changed my brain I made myself Dumber all week and I made myself Dumber get a bunch of stupid shit I should have never done it stupid shit yeah because in our Natural State we don't  do goofy shit enough right but then I learned when I quit drinking that I could be just as crazy people didn't realize I quit I've been hanging out my same friends in the same bars till 4:00 in the morning we'd go to a wedding I'd be the last guy on the dance floor first got on the dance floor and I just was like you know this doesn't have to change me you know yeah you can just enjoy fun he just enjoyed fun it takes a little bit more of  I think you have to sort of break through walls a little bit more as opposed to just the booze does that for you yeah but you can still get there that's a good way of looking at it the one thing that I found it affects my writing  marijuana is like steroids for writing oh my goodness really really like oh my goodness yeah yeah just dude this weekend soon as I started getting high again I'm a fucking my notebook full no shit was crazy ideas yeah man half her dog shit for yeah half of them at least 1/2 of 1/2 would be you're doing pretty well it's pretty good right yeah but I got a few that I mean there's something in this there's something in this one definitely something in this one so this is it like after the show you get high and then you write you write or you do it during the day well I  do any shows this weekend because I was in New York for the UFC and I had some friends that I know what's going to see why I was down there my friend Tommy so I was playing pool with him uh-huh and Hinchcliffe came with me to he plays pool too but I just decided not to call me this weekend I'm like I'm here for the UFC I only get a chance to see Tommy it's like one of my good friends from fucking 25 years ago more 28 years ago maybe yeah I might know him for almost  thirty years I've known him for fucking ever you know we become old men together yeah but you know we get together and play pool to like two o'clock in the morning I haven't had a chance to do that forever and I don't really get a chance to do it once a year when I see him mmm so I decided not to do any shows but just while we were playing I was getting all these ideas generally I like writing at night when everyone's asleep that's my favorite time to write I like to come home from the store  and I sit around with the laptop and you just start writing just forced myself to just write for an hour or so just just just right just free form just get it all down yeah have a subject to start I don't try to write like a joke for my try to write like essays and then I try to extract ideas out of those and then turn those into material yeah yeah that's the way to do it it's like it's like I used to do this thing called the writers way which is this great great way to if your it's not just for right  but just to get your creativity flowing and one of the things you do is you get out of bed in the morning and you don't have your coffee you just take a piss you don't have to take a piss you can shit like if you want to shit you can shit your well do you're allowed to shit okay as a matter of fact I think that probably helps a lot not oh yeah you don't want the what shit inside of you way trying to write well so what better feeling than your anus like re puckered after delivering like that it's just a joke  dump of lumber is the little halo over the log floating in the water yeah and then you sit down and you write for you write three pages non-stop you don't let the pain stop and then you go about your day and you get out it's amazing what your subconscious will get out when you just keep the pen flowing and like you said a lot of its garbage but within it there's going to be a couple kernels that are good yeah that's how creativity works with me I mean I'm not I'm not a consistent  not a 500 hitter in terms of creativity yeah if I get half half as amazing half would be made 500 is amazing yeah you know most of its garbage yeah sometimes I go back and just like just gets frustrating reading some shit I wrote yeah what the fuck are you but I know what I'm doing like when I'm writing I'm just trying to see if I could dig something out yeah I'm just like I'm out there with a metal detector did you do yeah today today today  dude you know you're right some guy just found some fucking incredible ancient treasure using a metal detector really yeah see see if we can find that Jamie so Beach yeah yeah I want to say fuck what era was it from ship right no no that was a different one that was it that was a got yeah that was a crazy one to a guy found a fucking shipwreck that was on the beach that was exposed by a  storm like a storm came along and it pulled away so much of the sand that a fucking shipwreck was their dad as those guys are walking his dog he's like what the fuck is this this is a boat yeah that's crazy here it is it's what is that three million pounds is that pounds War horde of 6000 gold artifacts from six fifty a d-- uncovered in Staffordshire field using a  metal to pound metal detector metal detector for two dollars laughs the pounds or Euros what does that one I think that's pretty so from 650 ad so 650 years after Jesus is murdered shit look at that shit look how gorgeous that is still get the fur on the top we're looking at a gold helmet this really intricate carved gold helmet with a fucking like a mohawk a firm Mohawk that's look at the detail I wasn't corroded at all  on that salt water all those years yeah that's pretty amazing we're Staffordshire was in it said it was in a field  hmm right this wasn't so this wasn't saltwater oh my god look how beautiful that shit is that's amazing a Scabbard boss I don't even know that what a boss it was a boss a Scabbard boss was that mean which is part of an Anglo-Saxon hoard found by Terry Herbert Terry's ball in right now yeah Terre Haute Terry what did Terry Duty sell it I mean do you keep saying you gotta keep some of it are you alone what happens there sold to museums for 3.28  five million with the funds were split between them he used metal detector so in the field of farmer Fred Johnson also they split him in Fred split it up  so they both got a million and a half not bad but it's pounds to dollars it's not the same exact a buck 20 so he's Super Bowl yeah 80% of the items identified were fittings from weapons mostly swords and research believe it's remarkable so many were made from gold wow nine pounds of gold included were 50 incredible rare gold sword pommels as well as parts of a golden helmet  fucking amen the golden age is period of anglo-saxon England  literally this was a period when gold was suddenly much more available and was converted into beautiful objects for the warrior Elite wonder why I was more available what makes gold more available to they figure out how to pull it out of the ground or something  if they hadn't started grabbing it from other countries yet I guess that was their own local gold look at this in the quotation on it look at this collection includes it's believed a battle Shrine with a processional and I don't know what that word means processional cross suggesting Christian emblems were used as good luck charms for battle on it is a quotation from the book of number which reads rise up Lord and let thine enemies be scattered and let them that hate thee  flee before thee boy yeah when you love to hear people talk back there yeah right like probably was so confusing like Game of Thrones they talk like us but they didn't talk like this yeah they had some weird lingo back with Game of Thrones obviously fake but it's supposed to be a long time ago right he and I'm sure they re sorry I mean everything about that show is so authentic I'm sure they went back and tried to find the way people spoke at that time well not really the right because it's not really about a time it's about a fantasy land well it was I think it was the War of the Roses  roses it was based on which was I think around the first century wasn't it  yeah but they got fucking the dark nights and or yeah white Knights or without ya know they mix a lot of it together King but I think there was a point where the where the British empire was divided into whatever it was five or six different oh that's what yeah that we're all fighting for the throne apparently never going to do a prequel now like those guys they were not going to do it they're going to cancel it but they're going to do it now I heard it got cancelled yeah I really got cancelled yeah but there was just something a couple of days ago that said  they're they're doing a preview hundreds of years before that's about the targaryens that's awesome fuck yeah get back after it you fucks come on Aang and give me anything the thing about that show is they kill everybody so they could always have new people yeah fucking kill everybody remember the Red Wedding holy shit yeah here we go HBO finally issued a statement on the canceled canceled thumbs down  what what what do they say what's their statement They're bringing back our less so then he space that's why he won an Emmy ladies and gentlemen that's right what is the statement that they have as good a good excuse what could there be a good excuse Peewee soccer we hate money just as they decide not to move forward with this fuck out of here well part of the problem is that who's the guy that wrote all the  they wrote the books that it was based on and he wrote the first George Martin George Martin wrote all them until they got to the last season at last two seasons and then he ran out of steam and that's why they weren't as good people say that last season wasn't as good as the rest because it was the to show Runners that it did it I thought the last season was excellent up until the last episode last episode was kind of like how do we in this yeah let's meet the guy in the wheelchair King yeah let's make him gay too yeah  come on man yeah you know yeah they didn't they didn't you know when you think about the last episode of any show is going to get a lot of remember how much shit Seinfeld got for the last episode yes because they didn't do anything and Game of Thrones did the same thing they they punted yeah they didn't go for anything right yeah the beautiful thing about Newsradio is last episodes we didn't know it was our last episode hmm it was the only time we ever thought we were going to get picked up notion that was how many seasons five the ratings were good yeah last  reason we like them we did pretty good yeah they're like fuck it's over why probably gets filled with dead yeah you know and love it's came back and love it's replaced Phil but how many seasons was that just one yes the final season yeah maybe I mean who knows it was also the problem with the news radio was Newsradio was not owned by NBC okay so it was one of those shows where that we moved at least eight times during the five years we were on the air  your time slot yeah just always moving and this is before the internet so you couldn't tell people it's not like you could tweet hey Newsradio is gonna be on Monday at 8 o'clock but you don't give a fuck cuz you have a DVR right which is DVR right now whilst you you found it when it was on yeah if you were lucky and they didn't advertise that much you know is like this radio moving to Friday at 8:00 you know it's like it just would move around we moved all over the fuck was it on NBC NBC yeah you ever have a good lead-in sometimes one time we were on the Thursday night  which was the big night with Seinfeld and friends and we crushed it yeah we were like number two in the world is that how they launched you or that also know I don't remember how we want they launched I don't remember but I remember one time we were on Thursday and everybody was so excited they lie on Thursday will be right after Caroline the shitty yeah this will be used to call it remember Carolina said yeah it was a few of those shows like the single guy like what is this if you want a tan forever because they were owned by someone actually there NBC or someone who had a deal with NBC  no brothers or whoever it was you know that's the weird thing about like television shows you can last forever if you have a good lead-in and then someone good after you because people just slack-jawed and keep that TV on right that's how it used to be at least now I think that model is kind of out the window now they take that that sweet spot after their number one show and they try to launch something they'll put something they like in there to get it legs and once it's good they try to create that  at and want that to be the lead in for another show it's like your fuck it's like baseball ranging baseball right well who the fuck would mean like who's watching TV with commercials now like who's sitting there and actually watching TV with commercials like how much time do you have and do you not know that there are so many shows that you could watch that don't have commercials yeah and you just wash those and record that one and then come back and watch him when it doesn't have commercials or fast-forward through the commercials yeah all right just get Hulu yeah I pay $10 a month and  the history of television from be Pilots I go back and watch pilots on Hulu that's the fucking greatest do the taxi pilot I just watched recently ixia forgot about taxi the taxi pilot was so fucking heartwarming it was all my God it was about Alex Krieger had a daughter that he hadn't seen he was estranged from he was basically like a deadbeat dad and it was about him reconnecting with her and the second half of the  I sewed was all of them in a fucking New York taxi driving down a Florida so he could meet his daughter nowadays it has to be like all right what's the simplest most basic storyline that lets you you got to get to know each character each relationship to great two or three Great ACT breaks there's so much criteria that go into the structure of it there's no room for anything where's the diversity where the diversity of diversity was the inclusiveness right inclusivity and the message was so harsh  yeah yeah you can just make a whack well you mean you kind of can Curb Your Enthusiasm is still that HBO yeah but the Network's haven't done much well then that works did cool stuff with like the office 30 Rock was kind of interesting well the dumbest thing in the Network's for sure are the presidential debates the fact that they take these people that are running for the most important job in the fucking known universe and they we're out of time thank you thank you mr. Senator thank you mr. Senator we're out of time thank you Miss congresswoman  thank you thank you mr. congresswoman you're out of time all right all right you have 80 Seconds to just fucking spill out as many words and get your point across to try to go viral yeah then and the worst part is then you got like the the also-rans that are like on the edge of the they got the last Podium on the left the guys like the mayor of Dayton and he's trying to get Headlines by taking a shot at the real candidate yes which is hurts the Democratic party yep you know she just makes the main guy look bad because he's so  as they got to winnow down the field or I think couple people just dropped out bait O'Rourke just dropped out shocking yeah I thought that guy has King written all over him at the beginning or at the beginning he never did he but he was this guy that he got hot from running against who do you run against Ted Cruz in Texas Texas of all places he's running against the guy who's a fucking you know arch-conservative and he comes out as his bleeding heart liberal and almost win  ins and it's like all the sudden Texas is not a red State it's starting to become like a purple State purple's a good word for it well Austin's very weird right Austin is this super Blue Area mmm in a red State yeah but it's also got a lot of cowboys and guns and barbecue yeah it's such a great place fucking gray place is one of the best places on Earth yeah really is and people figured that out to you go there and fucking traffic is absurd yeah you know like what what  you all here like yeah oh you found out it's awesome there's a there's a great place to shoot pool they're called the Jackalope Jacqueline jack-o'-lanterns Jackalope and it's just like you just go in there and fucking everybody says hi hey you want to shoot a game let me buy you beer exit great fucking music on the jukebox and I love that place yeah it's not well they're a little I mean they're kind of aware that it's supposed to be kind of cool so  they act a little cool like you know Keep Austin Weird those t-shirts by the way if you wear one of those fucking t-shirts let's Keep Austin Weird t-shirts you're a part of the problem you're not weird you know you're not weird and you're if you're selling them you're a piece of shit you just your fucking it all up you found this spot you're fucking doing those those Hollywood Lights you know when they have a premier yeah there's a spot yeah yeah come ruin it let's make a documentary about why it's cool when I first started going there though man I was just stunned I was like what cool fucking  these people are educated and aware but also Southern they have a Southern accent of Texas accent but they're also educated and very friendly and open-minded it's a very unique place that great fucking music yeah there yeah I'm playing I'm going to cap cities oh shit one of my favorite clubs it's great the only Club I did this whole year like on the road how no shit really yeah wow that said I'm going there yeah because I was about 4 or 5  months after my special and I just put together an hour that I could kind of go on the road with yeah you know and I'm like this this is good let's go to Cap City bang out two shows a night walk yeah yeah it's just a great place man it's a fun place like I've had so much fun there like that that club is just it's got fun soaked into the floorboards you know it's like just have fun it's a club where I mean so many great comics of perform there and so they got good taste  you know he had a curate good shows I mean they get they get all kind all kinds of Comedy like Maria Bamford will be there one week and the next week it'll be fucking Doug Stanhope or something like that it's just you know they're all over the place but it's not downtown though that's the only thing is you got to take a little Uber into town it's about yeah 5 10 minutes out yeah but it's at nighttime it's fine the real problem there is rush hour where they have a real rush hour now yeah they didn't have a real Rush Hour ten years ago yeah ten years ago you could get around Austin was no issue I think  it's where young kids get out of college now and when they used to go to San Francisco now they go to Austin yeah there's a lot of tech startups yeah there's a lot of the tech business yeah I mean on its there too there's a lot of shit there on it's there yeah on this shit on it on it Jim's there as well hold factories there everything's there yeah  you got there much not that often ya know maybe once a year now board meetings you have to be at I'm not a blood bank yeah I can picture you in your meeting stoned looking at your watch so jack in your fucking phone checking my Instagram let's see if anybody posted a good Epstein didn't kill himself meme  fucking have steam man what a story what a story and so now what did they say that it looks like he was Jim Gordon yeah his brother hired a real fucking autopsy guy to check it out including that guy Michael baton from that HBO autopsy show that guy said he was murdered you don't know who dinged I might have dang um remember that show HBO autopsy no it was a great show that was on basically pre-internet  I would watch these wacky fucking stories of like people that got busted murdering people by this this one really good autopsy corner and this coroner dr. Michael Baden one of the ones I'll never forget he took this one lady who's in love with this lady and she died and see he stole her corpse and had it in his house and put a tube where her vagina was and he'd bought cases and cases of perfume because she was  adding in his bed and he would just douse her in perfume and keep fucking her  wow dude and he put a tube in her vagina so that it didn't collapse well he put a tube there so we could fuck the tube he put a fuck hole in this dead lady's body damn yeah oh my god dude and apparently it was like the smell was insane yeah like horrific and this got one of the I think one of the ways they were suspicious like why is this motherfucker buying cases of perfume yeah but he put a mask over her face and you know just like just a fact  it used to be her yeah was enough all right forget his deal I think I want to say he was a doctor that was and she was a patient of his and he was in love with her huh yeah just some dude just had a fucking major fuse blow but yeah it just goes to show you don't know who it's going to be it's not just some derelict on the street could be your fucking doctor oh snap doctors are just humans man yeah they're just humans and a lot of them have access to drugs because of the fact they're doctors  there was a book called Dead Doctors Don't Lie and it was a basically the gist of the book was that a lot of people are dealing with mineral deficiencies and that mineral deficiencies were will it's by a guy named dr. Joel Wallach it's a controversial book and his ideas are fairly controversial but they're not controversial in the sense that like in animal husbandry and agriculture animal agriculture people are very aware that you need to supplement the diet of a lot of animals with minerals like for instance like so  some of the places where I hunt they don't they don't bait animals right these are wild animals that are in these giant ranches but when they have like there's a place in Utah that I go through it's like 270,000 Acres huge place but every you know fucking mile or so they scatter they'll put these mineral licks and it's a mineral licks so that the the deer and the elk get a minerals in their diet because animals like  desperately need minerals and sometimes they don't get enough of it from their diet and particularly from Foods where the the ground is deficient in minerals like when you like say if you have like if you're growing corn mono crops is what they call Mono crop agriculture you growing corn unlike fucking 700 Acres just growing corn well when they till that land like every year that that land has less minerals like you're not supposed to grow the same  thing in the same place forever right and the places that are doing it right they do what's called regenerative agriculture and there's a real good argument for it's one of the reasons why you like it's good to raise grass-fed cattle in these areas because the manure from the cattle actually is a great fertilizer it's good and you and also you know scraps from food fish and different things you need nitrate you need  nitrogen and nitrogen is very difficult to get you know when you want to put it into the ground for fertilizer and all these other different minerals phosphorus yeah all kinds of shit do you like you have to add that stuff to the soil now yeah because the top soil has been slowly eroded from continuous over farming and that his contention was that most of us when we even if you're eating like you know vegetables and you know you getting stuff at the grocery store you're getting things that are minerally deficient they're not optimally  mineralized that's word don't think that uh but there's not like so I take colloidal minerals it's just a liquid form of minerals like minerals that come from there's a type of water that's like a very rich in mineral water that it's called glacial milk and basically what it is is the runoff from glaciers that it carries it incredible amount of minerals in it to the point where the water actually kind of looks kind of Milky  and you can get that in some places some places on Earth people their water actually looks like that because it's got so many minerals in it yeah and these people have like dark hair and the you know there's health benefits are attributed to that right I'm not smart enough to know whether or not that's accurate but there's definitely some benefits and health benefit to taking minerals right people go to mineral spas I mean it was always the that was the miracle e alack sir yes sir yeah do you take any minerals for taking me here  exactly she'll milk yeah freshwater meets glacial milk and Iceland look at that that crazy damn so that's tough on the rise just fucking overwhelmingly packed with minerals say just bottle that Shin I think you know you probably could get too many minerals to I mean there's always liked the balance what is it what is it good intake like I don't take shit I think sometimes I take vitamin D vitamin D is good especially for a white fella like yourself you know  not getting enough sun right right that's why I take it and that's it 63 that's all I take D 3 is very good I take BR take Dr take I take multivitamins I take what this call it's a company called Pure pure encapsulations and they have a athlete pure pack is very nice because it's real simple we'll pack it I take not a sponsor take this packet just bring them with me on the road open it up and just take those  it's just and then I also take there's a there's a company called athletic greens and they make a really good supplement that I pour into water and it's very easy and it's got a bunch of different shit vitamins and minerals that is a sponsor yeah that's good that's good too because it's Whole Food based it's not there's nothing synthesized it's all based on food but I think you have you really should take something you know I mean it's so hard to make sure that you're getting all the vitamins that you need  from your food especially when you go on the road yeah on the road it's you know unless you know you're getting a you eating a really good organic restaurant we getting high quality vegetables high quality meat right it's hard hotels have gotten a lot better man in our lifetime Hotel food used to be garbage how about airport airport from the airport Foods gotten gray better got Lemonade's in there yeah you can get real food at the airport yeah yeah that's a that's a big issue man it's a big issue for people to go on the road because you know Ian  I'd like three four days in a row to eating fucking Jack-in-the-Box you start feeling like shit oh yeah and then if you're I mean Comedy Club food in 50 years has not gotten any better it's deep fried chicken wings and accept comedy magic club comedy magic Sky could Club food give you a fucking serious restaurants take their you could go there and eat a little jit excellent dinner now what am I saying yeah I've had plenty of dinners they're very great they do have good five houses good burgers to yeah  this house is very good burger uh-huh but comedy magic club probably tops and you know it's good to is hilarities in Cleveland they got the Pickwick and Frolic restaurant upstairs yes I was just a good restaurant I was just there really yeah we went to see Jesse met me and said Santino Jessie Mae was playing at hilarities and we were over at we were at this Arena so we came down and saw Jessie Mae and I had a prime rib was fucking Gates good right very good very good nick Costas got food poisoning no  oh boy yes he did have we don't know where you got it I'm assuming it was the vegetables I mean that's a lot of times when people get it you get it from things that aren't washed properly it's it out like they say that a large percentage of food poisoning cases are salad yeah I can see that yes handled wrong not washed correctly yeah you know a lot of people when they get E coli that get it from salad because of the runoff from animal agriculture runoff from the shit  it animal shit gets in the water the water gets into this the lettuce or the spinach is a big one Spanish a lot of people get a cool that's why if you go to a third world country you don't trust the water stay away from the salad oh yes the first thing you say is don't eat lettuce in a third world country good point yeah right like meat is meat right as long as it's seared on the outside you're golden oh yeah look at Anthony Bar Dan would he would just go to fucking Vietnam and go to a street meat shop with his no running water and he just gobble down some fucking whatever meat you know  meet it was well they used to drink wine when people would travel to prevent Travelers illness hmm because they didn't want to drink water because if you drank walk like you found up fucking upon somewhere and you try to suck some water out of it yeah like back then it wasn't a lot you mean you had to boil it that's it yeah you know nowadays you can get they have a bunch of different things you could do to water if you find it like you could take water out of a fucking El cual oh you know an elk wallowing now  it's like a puddle that elk piss in and they wallow around it and they get their scent on it they especially when they're running when they're having sex with the female elk they get in there and they piss all over the water and they roll around in it and so you get this muddy puddle and sometimes hikers like if you're on some serious fucking Trek you know you doing like the Appalachian Trail or something like that yeah water-scarce you can't find a creek you got to take the water out of an elk wallow a French friends have done that and you throw it through  filters if they do is they'll take it and they'll throw it through filters they'll put it through a biological filter first so the is like a filter that's like a pump but the problem is with those those pumps can get clogged up because they're basically taking the sediment and they and then they're filtering it out and then you get the water afterwards it still tastes like piss yeah because there's piss in it you're drinking piss you're just drinking piss it's not contaminated with something they can kill you so then a lot of times  guys even after that it takes something called a steripen ever heard of a stereo stereo is short for sterilization pain and it uses some kind of light for pull pull up steripen food I don't want to say this wrong but utilizing some sort of light some sort of forgot what kind of light what is it UV light UV light and you you keep it in the water for a certain amount of time I just nukes everything kills everything but still  amazing tastes like piss so you drinking piss yeah you definitely drinking piss so a lot of times guys will take like they sell these different there's a steripen so that little thing with that light you spin it around inside your glass of water and depending upon the amount of ounces a certain amount of time but it's not that much time ship shockingly it's like 10 minutes and sometimes guys even throw iodine tablets and water to like the whole deal is just kill anything that can fuck you up and just get over the fact that  it's going to taste like piss and then they also take like there's a bunch of companies like company called mountain tops they have stuff that like you throw into the water to make the water taste better what if you drink a glass of that if you saw a female elk and she started presenting get hard you get hard as a rock I think you'd probably want to suck an elf dick you probably you probably gave her hell no no it's not gay if it's an animal the male animals yeah yeah right  yeah interesting it's he had that they should get those into third world country some version of that it to help people drink water yes yeah well they definitely do they definitely do get filters and different things like that in a certain countries you know we're involved with fight for the Forgotten it's my good buddy Justin run he's got a charity where they build Wells for the pygmies in the Congo oh wow and through this  cast and through this company oh company called the cash app they've raised thousands of thousands of dollars and build a bunch of Wells they're in the process of building of now we've donated a bunch of money to that's amazing it's very cool but my point being this motherfucker was just here last week and he's got a parasite they can't even identify and he's had it for six months and he gets so fucked up like sometimes he works out and then you get to the point where his body turns pale and he starts shaking and shivering and they have to get him into a shower like shit dude they don't even know what it is like they think do you  what he said it was they think it was a type of parasite test in fact Lyme's disease recently yeah everything's yeah quite a few that have no idea they think it's in his brain whatever it is yeah and he's been on heavy heavy heavy antibiotics and of course one thing that comes with heavy antibiotics and particularly something called cipro is you you don't just get sick from that you also get your ligaments become very very relaxed and they get weak and a lot of people that come  come off antibiotics for a long period of time they are subject to injuries like athletes when they get staph infection they put you on this heavy dose of antibiotics but all your ligaments get weak in the end up tearing your ACL okay you know Terry he's got both of his shoulders or torn and he thinks it's probably a connection to the antibiotics that he had to take to deal with the staff or to deal with whatever the fuck this this infection is that he's got some very very strange parasite they he goes  deep in the Congo it might be an unidentified parasite that's part of the problem is that he's basically like a fucking lab rat right now and he's got malaria three different times wow that one's not was three times yeah fucking malaria three times did he he didn't take the anti malarial stuff it's still still did well here one of the things he got it and then he said the anti-malaria shit is so bad and it's so rough on you that some people would prefer to get malaria and get it treated huh  what is this stuff that he said that you get there's a toxic sickness that he got from Mal adorned with the fuck was it called I think that word for melodium melodium there's a type of anti-malaria medication that they give to particular to soldiers and they find that these guys it's fucking incredibly toxic and they found it in his brain they found that he's got he's suffering from poisoning from this  time malaria medication my he was on like really high doses of this shit too if you live somewhere like that you're supposed to be taking it all the time constantly us what the fuck you know when they built the the melodium with the Panama Canal they went down there the French tried to dig it for like 50 fucking years and they'd we're dropping like flies from the Malay they didn't know his for malaria they had no idea what was going on they just knew people were getting sick yeah while they were trying to  I mean the scope of that project at that time was insane I mean they were hand digging a fucking canal canal from I mean through like thick jungle in the middle of the country and the middle of the country and they were just people were getting sick and then they would eventually France after 50 years said fuck it and then he just left and then for some reason we bought it we're like we can do it slow down there meh flow  Queen methyl clean that sounds like a queef she met Phil cleaned so we show up and they realize 1.4 somewhat spell it spell it out and put it up put it up there again so we get a mellow Queen meth flow Queen sold under the brand names Larry mm that's what I've heard I've heard medication to prevent or treat malaria to use for potential to start a potential exposure and continued for several weeks after potential exposure and then people get sick off of that stuff yeah  that's not it that's definitely okay all right seems wrong like the name some jumped on it that's what I looked up I know but it doesn't seem right to you it seems wrong to me I don't know I'm sure it's right but it just  so we go in and some genius goes it's the fucking mosquitoes it's we're getting an infection from the mosquitoes so they've simply got rid of standing water they just started finding they had teams of people everyday would go out and they find puddles and they would get rid of the puddles and the more they went from going like I'm telling you one out of three people is dying trying to dig this tunnel and they went to almost nobody dying you know malaria is killed some insane number of people we looked it up once I think  the rumor is it's killed half the people who have ever died ever know shit have been killed by malaria whoa yeah that was what I had heard I think it's less than that that they can that they can definitely determine was killed by malaria but nevertheless it's a staggering number of humans those little dirty mosquito yeah I think we can get rid of them right yeah they're trying to do that the trying to genetically engineer  veneer mosquitoes that don't carry malaria and then they're also thinking that you know this is really dangerous really dangerous that they could just get rid of mosquitoes period but the problem with that is man you don't know how all that shit's connected and what happens if you get rid of mosquitoes would have the Beatles take over the Beetles start carrying diseases they start biting people like do what morphs like a mosquito wasn't always a mosquito this must be understood right a mosquito  one point I was a single-celled organism just like us and then it became a mosquito and found a really good Niche right it's like this fucking mosquito business is the shit right yeah it's like fast food like you can't go wrong mosquito business is awesome sure they fucking go crazy yeah all they need is a little bit of water and any living thing that they can take a little fucking drop of blood from did you ever go to my when I rented a house in Encino did you ever go to that place I don't think so I think was before you moved out here when I first moved out here  I've rented this house in Encino nobody lived in it for a couple of years and the the fucking pool had not been taken care of so the pool was green like the Hulk's dick okay and I looked in the pool and it was little things were swimming like schools of fish and I was like what the fuck is this and the pool guy goes oh bro that's mosquito larvae I was like what he goes yeah he goes you we gotta kill this now before you literally infect the entire neighborhood with mosquitoes like there was  fish no shit swimming wow like filled with mosquito have you ever seen mosquito larvae in the pool it was so disturbing I was like I gotta get a hotel he's like no no we can kill it we can kill it but they had a poor like fuck the drain the entire pool and poured gallons and gallons of poison in there they just filled and I couldn't swim in it for like six months or something I don't remember but it was so nasty you can see this little fucker swimming like schools of fish  shhhh that's amazing I go to schools wow yeah standing water yes standing water man that's all it takes that's why you got a fountain you have little fucking bubbles running through it we are so so lucky when it comes to bugs out here that I know we got no bugs no bugs what we got we got termites that's the only thing that they're fucking Insidious we built a fence around our house took like six weeks they put it in and and six months later there's fucking like  will you never see shavings from the bat powder on the bottom like you motherfuckers brought termite infested wood to my house and now it's in my house also the would have come I tell ya can you sue I'm probably I'm not really a sewer what are you plot Revenge just a guy who gets sad when things happen Revenge don't say that I'm Irish Sylar yeah well having I'm an arsonist and find the next project is going to do take it down so  so they brought wood that had termites in it yeah for sure well the wood had fucking termites in it maybe contact the contractor and I don't even remember this was like 15 years ago whatever is fence still there yeah but it's like I tried to screw something into it the other day and it wouldn't hold the fucking screw it's like powder underneath the whole thing needs to be ripped down you could run through that fence like the whole yeah cool we're not keeping anybody else the Hi-C guy yeah  meeting at my house the Kool-Aid guy right hey Kool-Aid remember that yeah what happened the Kool-Aid guy they just stopped that campaign I was a huge campaign he ran through the fucking house everywhere yeah kids were his sitting there boy I'm thirsty boom fucking take a picture yeah picture with a face on it runs right through your house you kids want a fucking bucket of sugar with some water in it boy it was a delicious though oh yeah I had some Kool-Aid a couple years ago I ate at this place in what's that  shitty town in California Fresno is a place called God damn it I follow them on Instagram it's a soul food place in Fresno  trying to remember Paul's Kitchen is that it Chef Paul's Cafe and you know sometimes you're on the road you find a place that's just fucking off-the-charts good if you're in Fresno ladies and gentlemen Chef Paul's Cafe I fucking give it two thumbs up oh shit 5 Stars full on soul food like fucking collard greens oxtails like phenomenal food and they also had Kool-Aid man has okay well obviously  see I'm going all in I got to get the Kool-Aid to I hadn't had Kool-Aid and probably a decade is that a selfie thing Kool-Aid I don't know is their menu thing yeah they had a bunch of crazy shit on the menu yeah good that's it right there but you know it's a great restaurant in a sketchy Town yeah Fresno sketches fuck I mean you got like like we were driving down the street there's like homeless Community skid roast I look at that food dude seriously chicken and waffles yeah oh my God their food is so good they're Fried Chickens off  off the charts but the oxtail I had oxtail there's chicken and waffles that looks good it's so good man that place is amazing and it's just super super authentic like down-home like real hearty comfort food there's a Kool-Aid right there baby Kool-Aid on the menu I mean why not man just get all the flavors when you're at a place like that right don't drink water you asshole get all the flavors get yourself some collated catch yourself some Kool-Aid  well that's what Red Bull is isn't it's just Kool-Aid Red Bull has taurine in it and taurine is actually originally from bull come really yes torian is a stimulant that's derived from bulges and Hitler used to actually take bulk um I think I found that out from Tom Papa was I who told now someone told me that and we googled it I was like what like they figured out a way to synthesize it but Tory  green is one of the actual ingredients in bulges - so people used to take bulges as some sort of a stimulant I guess here it is Heil Hitler oh hi Hitler medical records show fuhrer Adolf was a cocaine addict in was injected with bull semen to help his sex life he also took steroids he took a lot of testosterone he suffered from flatulence known to break wind during meals with his generals oh they all ratted him out  I wonder if you say to a guy who's killing millions of Jews that was offensive yeah that smell is offensive your farts or worse than what you've done to the Jews right you guess them your guys on us now well he was a vegetarian too why is he yeah if you eat a lot of vegetables like the gas broccoli farts yeah they're famous oh yeah it's because your body's breaking down all that fiber yeah I think it has something to do also with the the the vegetables are breaking down faster than the meat if you eat meat and vegetables and they get  get caught in your intestine that's where you get pockets of gas and meets blocking it up fermenting yeah steaming up Creighton gasps yeah dude I've been fartin phenomenally I enjoy farting do you and my wife laughs at it thank God we wouldn't still be together over oh yeah you don't even let her know it's coming now it's an it's I will walk in the room with the fart because she laughs at I don't know what it is she thinks it's funny every fucking time I fart so you guy  she is and she far she wishes she could fight as much as I do but when she does she lets me know our family does the whole family farts son farts at the dinner table we all laugh yeah we're very open about it but do you think that that's going to carry on to his next relationship I hope so I hope so too but it's hard to find a gal that's down with that I think you got to make them down with it you see he's a man you start with a little one and then gently you just you know  if they smell you take it in the other room but if it's just a and you know your cycle usually know what's in the tank same time the previous ones sometimes you don't sometimes you think your float an air biscuit you let out a bomb yeah yeah damn whenever I'm getting on a plane I try to I try to get a few out before I get on the plane when I'm on that that ramp you know what's weird this is really strange I mean really strange and not a lot of people are aware of this when you are around certain smells like  if you're like say if you're butchering an animal okay we save you shot an animal in the field and you're hunting you cut it up and you the smells that come from that animal will be in your farts even if you don't eat it wow it's weird oh shit weird and I recognize this but I was confused by it and then it was brought up to me by friends that are hunting guides in Alberta my friends John and  and the rivets they've got this guide service and one of the things they hunt is bears and bear is delicious but you have to cook it right because you can get trichinosis it's like pork same kind of deal but they smell like they're their guts and like when you're butchering them like they a lot of times people use What's called the gutless method it's means you take all the meat out without opening up the gut cavity because if you do get that stuff on you like it's but it's specifically if they've been eating something that's right  Otten the smells horrible that smell comes out in your farts and one of their daughters canceled school she stayed home because she was farting so bad she's like I can't go to school farting like this yeah I will be a pariah  but I've smelt it before some is like did you have bear yet like if I've shot a deer in the field and you're we do we it's called quartering it you got it you take out the heart and the liver you eat the heart and the liver you take out the heat 1/4 it you take like the limbs off you take like the legs off and you take the meat off the back it's called the back straps and The Tenderloins you take all that stuff off and then when you fart you fucking smell that animal in your farts wow and  this was addressed actually by my friend Steve rinella on the show meat eater they were trying to figure out why like they're like okay this is a real thing right like everybody talks about this like how is he getting in you you're smelling it and then somehow or another those molecules come out Google all the way through your body from you smelling it and breathing in that air and comes out in your farts and you smell this horrific like gut smell  sounds like a good game show you know you go into your room and you come out and the contestants have to guess what animal you just core lamb  I wonder if that's the case we I mean must be the case with fish to Lucky catch a bunch of fish you got them and then you probably smell fish farts when you're farting probably smell like fish but the weird thing is that would make sense of your eating it right if you cooked it and ate it that would make sense but this is I'm telling you this is farting when you've had none of it yeah you haven't eaten any of it but you fart yeah you smell it I think I fart  I think you fart from getting nervous also like if you're a nervous person I think you fart a lot that makes sense right your gut starts building all the juices and stuff yeah here is farts can fight Strokes heart attacks and dementia sign it that's fair that girl she farts your face you don't get a heart attack that he's got a hot chick in the study has proven that farts can help yourselves to live what what sulfur hydrogen sulfide  as well known as a pungent foul smelling gas and rotten eggs and flatulence it is naturally produced in the body and could in fact be a healthcare hero with significant implications for future therapies for a variety of diseases can you imagine if all those weirdos that pay women to fart in their face if they're onto something right those women are heroes those are the most confusing porn videos I've ever seen  that what guys are like laying there girls like you would like to fart dirty bitch and they fart in the face yeah Mommy give me that fart Mommy and they fart in their face oh it's so fucking it's so confusing makes me shut my laptop and walk around the block that's fucking great I've seen a bunch of those you never seen one of those no I've never seen it I'm just trying to figure out who the first guy was it had the balls to just go so like smelling a fart and going I think this is it I think this is my you know for some people it's its feet  you know right some people it's fart wow if that's a thing with guys farting in the face the sump some people like a lot of weird shit like I had this girl on the podcast back in the day and actually make me sad talking to her name is Ciara Lynch remember her because like I was like what like what she's selling her piss she sells like toenail clippings dirty socks dirty underwear all these guys and then she humiliates these guys they want her to humiliate them and the worst she treats him  she's what I believe she refers to her and she's a very smart girl very pretty too she refers to herself as a humiliate tricks  like it's like that's her business right she bought a fucking house like she's wow wealthy because of getting these guys to buy her shit and piss yeah very strange I think I got an A new nickname for my wife humiliate tricks  but I met this prostitute in Lake Tahoe she knew she'd come to my show and she was like you know in Nevada it's it's all legal and so she I go what's the weirdest client that you ever had and she goes well I don't know if you're ready for this but I met this guy and he lived in Colorado and he had been in in Nevada liked her said she said she's up for anything sends a jet to take her to Colorado oh Jesus  Denver to some five-star hotel come up to the suite presidential suite they come and she's like I have no idea what this is about and he goes now this is going to be weird but it's not gonna hurt you Just Go With It Room Service shows up guys got a tray he's got four plates of hamburger meat uncooked just

pounds of hamburger and he just stood there and she kept stuffing it up something out no erection no sex no touching her and then back on the jet back to Nevada so he's a wealthy guy he paid her a ton of money oh my God  I'm surprised but I'm not surprised like if you said Would You Bet Your Life that there's a guy out there that sent a private jet to get a prostitute and take her to a nice restaurant and then paid her to stuff hamburger meat up his ass if you're wrong you die yeah I go yeah Peg happen right right a million monkeys typing you know I mean I'm not I'm not I'm  prized but I'm not stunned right I'm not like no way I don't believe that yeah I believe it well and the the the funny thing is like I don't get the sense this guy is on a chat room talking to other guys that

other people have been it's been they've been recalled hey yeah you can get salmonella anally for sure it's raw gotta tell your doctor fuckin a what happened well have a seat  let's start from the beginning when I was a boy first I started getting hard-ons I sat on a cheeseburger and do you think these guys is if I shove solid food up my butt would I gain any nutrition from it first of all here's the thing he's answered by Andrew Lee doctor of acupuncture hey fuckface you didn't go to medical school stop calling yourself a doctor doctor of acupuncture is so weird it's like  I'm a doctor of Comedy yeah you know what I mean write your practice acupuncture you're not a doctor they don't go to medical school did you know that I didn't know that doctors are doctors a doctor goes to a medical school it's hard you have to study you have to do your residency you have to get your fucking degree at a medical school not chiropractors they call themselves doctors yeah but they don't go to medical school at all right at all and they can  fuck you up they do those cracks in your neck pull that up so we could read that  so answer is things can be absorbed through the membrane through membrane what see this is out right after I was just showing you that people have asked us no I'm saying but listen the way he writes the answer this is how a chiropractor rights versus a real real doctor things that can be absorbed through membrane will bypass the liver when taken through the anus through membrane will bypass the liver through a membrane  okay for example various drugs can be taken as through the anus in order to be easier on the liver Jesus how chiropractors right yeah CCI is writing this is not a guy went to medical school now as the liver no longer needs to filter the drug which makes the drug half as potent and is also hard on the liver this guy's Asian how do you know that butts is named Andrew Lee yeah I did not know his name when I said he's at  and I didn't tell by the way he was right alcohol can cross the cell membrane and thus absorbs very easily into the human body oh how about this my friend his wife is a school teacher in Utah and they have a problem in middle school because kids are taking tampons and they're soaking them in rubbing alcohol and stuff them up their assholes and they getting high really yes well one kid found out  about it

had we've had a couple of Massachusetts Republicans like fuckface the Mormon what's his name Romney yeah Mitt Romney fuckface Charlie Baker Republican he's a republican to that's interesting that is interesting well you were talking about Texas in Austin yeah and Massachusetts is  a Republican state Boston as a democratic City but it's such a big part of the state that it's like what Austin is to Texas and also like Minneapolis to Minnesota yeah I guess so huh like where would you think the Republicans are in Massachusetts everywhere outside of Boston well I think it's a lot of Defense contracts there's a lot of Defense money there and Dynamics right right I got tricked they tricked me they did I posted one a video it's boss town  Amex they will be OSS tiwi Dynamics and it was a video of like robots shooting guns and they're kicking the robots and it's hitting these targets perfectly every time I'm like oh my God we're fucked but the thing is it's not that far removed from what the Boston Dynamics robots already do those fucking robots already doing backflips yeah do backflips yeah they do like parkour they run and jump off things and hang on things and then this one it was a fake video though was a CGI think yeah  those guys that's what they do and how do you trust anything anymore Jesus Christ well we're pretty close to not being able to trust anything in yeah because with those those deep fake generators where they could take you like 30 done videos with me where they have audio of me saying shit that I would say like a bunch of shit that I would say but I never said it about like champ armies and all those different things yeah yeah there's a whole website dedicated to that  it's just weird man yeah and it's going to get weirder and weirder with the the stuff that they can do with your you've seen Kyle Dunnigan yeah fucking page yeah the crazy God yeah oh my God and His the stuff that he does that's my favorite that's really really funny is the stuff that looks fake it's like he does the face swap shit from like the Instagram filters or SnapChat or whatever it is but he did a bunch of stuff because he was doing a pilot for Comedy Central and thank God they're too fucking stupid to pick it up because they would have ruined  it is he was showing me one that they wouldn't do it was Caitlyn Jenner having sex with Trump he was showing it to me I was crying I was in The Green Room crying goes yeah Comedy Central said no to that one what yeah look what they like nose to it was too edgy yeah they wouldn't get involved anything trans yeah right right like come on that's why I was shocked at on the roast that that she came out and said the shit that she did that was like that was excuse the pun but that was ballsy what did she say I think she still has her balls she said she  stores are addicted oh really yeah what did she came out and said I love that expression she has her dick welcome to 2019 yeah but done again I did a show with him on Saturday night and he came out on stage and he put He put a laptop in front of his face and there was a big screen and he was doing the characters for the crowd that he usually does like as Instagram oh yeah I've heard he does yeah it was great how does he do that it just has the video plays  I guess the computer is videotaping him and sending it I know it ran through the house through something in the house system because it was a fuckup it got fucked up oh but it still worked because he was we were doing a gig at the store on a Friday night and he was supposed to be on right before me but there were like actually let's have Kyle going after you because apparently his whole thing needs a big  set up confirms gender reassignment study but she confirms gender really hold on put the backup says Caitlyn Jenner confirmed gender reassignment surgery in 20/20 interview okay but the problem has she just did an interview recently she said she still has it hmm what is gender reassignment surgery they fucking wave a wand over you like a like the night you I hereby announce you have a vagina  I have a vagina yes  all right now have a vagina okay I mean look and they're tapping you on the head with your penis you're clearly a man and you could just say you're a woman why can't you say you have a vagina we're going to play make-believe let's just play make-believe all the way yeah fuck it yeah because look my friends Ubi he was a guest on the podcast he claimed he was a woman for a day and broke the women's world record in deadlift  what did he have to do to qualify as a woman you have do anything he's just Dad identifies woman yeah  I mean what who are you to say that he did not identify as women you fucking transphobic piece of shit and now I feel bad now should Jesus Christ Greg all years we've known each other I just feel like leave I didn't know that you have this in you as my childhood I think that's okay I wish I was big enough to get cancelled I gotta get a little bit more famous and then it can happen yeah I'm more like me who  Club joke that such upon God now I think pull up I think that Caitlyn Jenner still has his dick her dick sir fight with a guy that that became a woman and then beat the shit out of a woman um you mean MMA I don't know if we boxing or MMA yeah it was yeah she had a few fights the problem was not that she had the fights which I would never advise anybody to fight someone who used to be  a man I would say probably got a lot of physical advantages that's not going to show up in the weight class like just because they're both 235 pounds there's a fucking difference I don't give a shit what anybody says there's a reason why this woman world-champion cyclist is breaking records so I women deadlift these these women weight lifters who used to be men are breaking records like by giant numbers I mean giant numbers in powerlifting and they all they have to do is just say they used to be a man and now I'm a woman this is it oh she's a woman  and your piece of shit if you say anything different there's just but this one was fighting her name is Fallon Fox and she was fighting as a woman even though she'd been a man for 30 plus years and in fact even had kids at all kid and then just transitioned became a woman didn't tell anybody said it was a medical issues none of your business and beat the fuck a tattoo women and like beat them like domestic violence like you watch it you like what yeah then she came out and it was like this big  big hubbub I got caught up in it because I said it was nonsense or said it was I said it's worse than nonsense I was like it's bullshit it's a hundred percent bullshit and I never never been tacked harder oh I shouldn't have brought it up I didn't realize care it's fine look I fucked that's a he'll die on yeah that's a hill I'll die on like you guys are out of your fucking mind yeah I think you're out of your mind with track and field I think you're out of your mind with weight lifting you're out of your mind with all those things but if it comes to fighting fuck you fuck you you think a man or woman of the same thing you are  our out of your God damned mine if you think all you have to do is get a little bit of surgery take some hormones and you're a woman now and you should be able to fight women magic that's your daughter and your daughter is getting pummeled by someone who used to be a man fuck you it's crazy yeah it's crazy well it's unfair to the female athletes you know women are real women real women are getting fuck your real women are training their whole fucking lives that you know what they're with their sacrificing to be the best woman out there and then to compete event  somebody who's got to stas Turon that just puts them at a whole different level physically well here's the deal I know it lowers it testosterone but it's still there it doesn't know it lowers it significantly but the gains that they've had through growing up through puberty with testosterone and being an XY chromosome having the bone structure of a man those are undeniable and their undeniable by the world records that these trans women are winning they're beating men I mean they're beating women but biological women  I jaunt numbers like tract someone sent me this the states that allow people in college and in high school to compete as the gender that they identify with without surgery or you don't have to you know I have to have surgery and a lot of these places they are dominating dominating its dominant  trans people trans people running these things trans always always male to female never female to male female to male aren't they selling no chicks are like like saying identifies a man let me get in the NBA and fucking postnup 40 against LeBron that's not happening it's not it's doesn't go down that way with what goes down is men who want to be a woman become a woman and then want to compete against biological women and in every single case the biological women are getting fucked over because if a woman  save a woman was 30 years old and she decided at 30 years old she was going to start taking hormones and become a man and compete against man she'd be fucked but if a man does that he's got the benefit of having testosterone in his system for 30 years and then transition to becomes woman and there's there's no denying there's a gigantic Advantage if a woman was going to compete like save she's going to compete in track and field and she's 30 years old but for  all of her life she's been taking steroids her whole life she's been taken just just steroids get it get a man John a thick neck and fucking shoulders roll and then she gets off of it just gets off of it for a couple years and competes against women just throwing them around and dragged on people be like she's a cheater she cheated she took steroids for 30 years just because she's not taking him now doesn't mean she's not a cheater well that's what's happening yeah it's but it's worse because the bone structure and because  it's a natural testosterone your fucking puberty you're going through puberty with testosterone it's crazy it's crazy it's fucking crazy and it's almost even crazier if you didn't go through puberty so how about if you're a trans person and someone decided when you're five or six years old that you're trans and so now it what you someone's transitioning you before when somebody had a great joke about that like you don't let a five-year-old pick their outfit why would you let them pick their gender like you can't let a  and say what they are what they are kids are a giant part of what a kid is you're so easily influenced by your environment right so easily influenced it's so easy to convince a kid one way or the other and you don't know what's happening right in their home and you're asking this child to make a decision about their biology you've talked about in terms of starting to take take drugs yeah I mean the idea of doing that to a little kid to me is fucking bananas doesn't make any sense yes we're leaving this weird fantasy world  right now where people want to be so Progressive and they want to be so open-minded they don't want to be transphobic so we're letting people say and do absolutely Preposterous things that don't have any logic that the don't make any sense in terms of what we know about biology doesn't make any sense and particularly when it comes to sports particularly when it comes to your life you're a grown adult I don't care I'm happy for you if you live better as a woman you feel better as a woman you're a  and to me congratulations I don't care but you're competing against men you can go fuck or it competing his women rather you can go fuck yourself you're not a woman in the sense of you don't have double X chromosome you didn't grow up as a woman you're not a biological woman if you want to be treated as a woman that's fine but you can't just decide you're a woman and now you're going to break World Records in fucking dead lifts and you're going to you know run faster than any woman that's ever lived you're going to beat them on bike races you're going to break World Records  well as a trans woman you're crazy what happens to all these regular women that didn't get the the advantage of growing up through puberty with testosterone they getting fucked over that's the reason why we have men and women's divisions in the first place Hmm this is weird cop out that well there's always it's not fair and some sports because there's LeBron James Haiti's LeBron again you know there's Mike Tyson there's there's there's these outliers who these freak physical specimens yeah yeah there are but they're men versus men this freak physical  specimens in men but when you go so far so far over that when you when you take a biological male and they're just breaking world records as a woman you got to go come on we're entering into this complete nonsense area yeah but this is just Progressive thinking this ideology taken to the extreme yeah he and I mean I don't know what the answer is because the women if they do start taking testosterone then they obviously  we can't compete against women legally any longer no so they're they're sort of in limbo I don't know if there needs to be a third category trend of Athletics the trans categories for that's the perfect answer yeah that's the perfect answer I don't think even if the women take steroids if it would be fair I don't I don't even know if that would be fair because they're still not going through puberty like you would have to mean first of all there's not a lot of data on this there's not a lot of data in terms of a years and years of  competition where they've studied athletes that have been trans versus athletes that have been biologically female versus athletes that are biologically male we don't lose a lot of studying on this this is people going with the current thinking and the current Progressive ideology where they don't want to be criticized they don't want to be called transphobic they don't want to have articles written about them or people call them terrible names and talk shit about them and it's such a small percentage of the population  ocean and it's become an issue that is being identified for political reasons you know it's something that is like like my kid is a college now and like every class you have to say your name what gender you identify as and what pronoun you want to be referred to as do you how many fucking people this is affecting whizzer five in the school if that if that it's I believe the current number of people that are trans in this country somewhere  around one percent is that what the numbers  do we even know what's fun now I'm fine with all of it up until it comes to sports hmm I mean if you just if you want to identify with a them you know you want to be a very personal I might fuck up occasionally because it's odd yeah I might make mistakes if you want to be called Caitlin okay hi Caitlin I don't care I don't care right but with sports you can fuck all the way off 0.6% okay that's hilarious it's not even one  half of a basically half of a percent and Elizabeth Warren she's getting shit because she was she was supporting trans prisoners having the right to have corrective surgery in jail and of course people had a field day with like the amount of money that that would cost and it's like she should just say pass what's your opinion on that Elizabeth let me talk about the economy  let me talk about health care yeah that's not a good one but that's one that I guarantee you if you sat down and talked to her about it like this is this is an ideologically based opinion that's she's probably looked at their her demographic which is Progressive left wing you know she's a woman she's running for president and a big part of her being candidate is a fact that we would like to have a woman president particularly people on the left they look it fucked up with Hillary Clinton didn't go well maybe it was with Warren's our gal yeah  she seems to talk well she's strong experience maybe she's the one maybe she's the one well well she's got to support that because you want the whole Democratic party otherwise someone will fucking snatch up those people in an independent category green category yeah like fuck it I'm voting for Jill Stein because she's a piece of shit or Elizabeth Warren's a piece of shit and she won't she doesn't address trans rights yeah there was a lot of third-party voters in the last election they go along the election I was one of them  Stein Gary Johnson now he did my podcast oh no shit yeah so I said I'll vote for you what was his deal  well he didn't know government guy anything about what he was sunk because he didn't know what we're Aleppo was oh I remember that yeah yes Uncle yeah like people were considering him fairly serious huh hmm maybe I'm serious about Gary Johnson he seems fairly reasonable why don't we could use a reasonable guy and they asked him what do you think we do about Aleppo he's like what the fuck's Aleppo like yeah that's right  it's a city where a lot of bad shit is happening but did Trump know where Aleppo was he doesn't have to  he doesn't have to they could say what you gonna do about Aleppo he probably where's Aleppo Syria oh well that place is a mess yeah and we dealt with that I think we're done with that I think we cancel them so aleppo's in Syria right so we're just  think that's what it is yeah but it was almost like a trick question yeah you know because who fuck  he didn't know but who does who did I got all the peoples like this for Community doesn't even know where Aleppo is I didn't know where I left I was yeah I didn't know the question either yeah obviously I'm not running for president well we're kind of hoping that that that person knows the shit we don't know where they tell him when he gets in there but that's the scary thing about Trump is that other leaders will have advisors around them that they trust right tell them stuff but Trump doesn't seem to read the who's only interested in the he's not interested in  they blew the fuck out of him at the UFC oh were you there yeah oh because it because I heard from one camp that they cheered and from other camp today his son said they cheered for him listen to Daddy I took my fucking headphones off just to listen and it was whoo yeah man 18,000 people going his son said they were chanting USA maybe four people behind him were chanting USA  as for saying boo as I say here I would Donald Jr said yeah that's Donald Jr is that was worried that you'd probably say that to look they booed the fuck out of him yeah I'm sure some people clapped yeah I'm sure but if you had a if you had a bet your money on it like what was the greater percentage was it booze or claps it was fucking booze yeah dude I took my headphones off uh-huh I was right there yeah I was 50 I can hit him with a rock he was right over there yeah boo yeah I'm surprised he showed up after what happened at the  World Series the same fucking thing happened a week before but maybe figure because he was DC it was because it's so liberal and DC probably figure because it was at the fight yeah cage fights I mean he'll also he's friends with Dana White and they're good friends okay don't leak like they were there's a picture on Dana's Instagram of him and Donald sitting in front of the television watching fights the watching the prelims before he went out Dana watches some of the card in his green room  listen to the commentary and you know wants to see some because like there's a lot of moving pieces involved being the president of the United States and also the president of the UFC a lot of moving pieces you don't have a lot of time to sit through the entire Pay-Per-View while you're there so Dana sits in the back and he watches a lot of the pay-per-view card on the screen in his in his office or in his green room so he was back there with Donald sitting on the couch and you put it on his Instagram just watching some fights it's just him and Trump sitting there  hilarious yeah wow is watching my friend Corey Anderson damn knockout Johnny Walker so look at that watching fights like what you think Dana Dana White's been the fuck is this kid could be Basque him where my father Visa send location yeah it's his father can get a Visa yeah ask Donald bro come on did the good free khabib give you got 46 thousand likes on that walking the massive Square Garden  staying with Dana White for the big UFC championship fight was a little bit like walking to a trump rally plenty of Maga and KAG present what is kg oh hmm okay great energy fantastic job Tina headed to DC and then to Kentucky for the big Matt Bevin rally okay well look for sure some people cheered for sure for sure for sure some people waved at them some wavy people look some people like to see him  hmm look if I was in the crowd and I wasn't hammered and he was there I'd be like what's up bro hey I'd yell at them I'd say hide wave at them but the reaction like when he walked in it's a lot of booze yeah but that's just fucking gonna happen man he's a controversial character you know like anywhere he goes you're gonna get it oh look it's fun to boo yeah it's fun to go fuck you it's fun you're going to do something when you see somebody you're either going to cheer you're going to boo ya me get secret service all  Adam there's there was a lot of noise man a lot of noise but a lot of it was yeah  but it wasn't it wasn't like fuck Trump fuck Trump there was no chant you know this place is where he can't go right like if he went to an lbgt rally I would guarantee yeah that's a place where you can't go right even if he's Pro lbgt with his his policy that's place where they gonna they're gonna be like pretty universally hated him yeah where would you say he can't go where where wouldn't be a good move I think any kind of a woman's movement like oh yeah  me to marches yeah what if you dressed like when they have those women marches were all wearing the pussy hats walk down the street and they have a little feet they have speakers in the has he put something set up a stage and it comes out to address them he starts grabbing everybody's hat grandmother pussy at what what what well possess someone to want that job I mean look if you wanted to have the the best case scenario answer it's like I want to do  do a good job and make this country great and do better and but what do you think really it's ego I was watching Andrew Yang on some morning talk show on Sunday and he's he's walking down the street with his wife and it's a Sunday it's got his fucking kids and I'm like this is your Sunday he's got followers with his name on his a legend like strangers with Fitzsimmons on a placard walking behind you cheering on a Sunday I want to be home when I watch a fucking football game  with my kid making meal but these people every day they're working 16-hour days where their speak saying the same shit and they're saying we're we're winning and they always say we know just say I am be as fucking selfish as you really are I'm winning more people are liking me than those other people hmm  it's a bad job it's a bad job that no one should have it's a job that should be a giant Round Table of geniuses should be deciding the fate of the country yeah and they all should be on mushrooms they all should be on ego dissolving doses of mushrooms so that none of them are acting in their own self-interest they all should have zero financial investments in anything that has anything to do with any decisions that they make like they should have to give up all their stocks  they should have to absolutely make sure like like Trump is able to have Al's businesses be run by his kids which is kind of hilarious yeah but then he makes decisions that would benefit his businesses that are being run by his kids and as soon as out of office he jumps back in and takes over again which is like yeah it's what do you think's going to happen when they get its taxes because they're pretty close I pretty good it's going to go to the Supreme Court now the last court said that he has to turn them over and what they're doing is they're going after his accounts  accountant instead of him that way the accountant will be liable as opposed to him personally because he's never going to do it but if you're if you're fucking you know Harvey Altman and Company you have to you got to do it you're not gonna go to jail for him right you sewed up with Michael Cohen right you go to jail yeah there's no pardons you're going to jail bunch of went to jail yeah quite a few people in jail manafort Jana for it jail real jail yeah like like you can't see anybody  the cell jail it's not gonna matter when his taxes come out it's not going to matter it's nothing none of it matters he's got his file the only thing this election comes down to is whether or not the left can get people to show up because his 46 percent or whatever percent are into him they are fucking there on November 4th next year they're showing up you know it was crazy Chris Rock went on stage right after he won and Chris Rock said you don't know that motherfucker he goes let me tell you something here  I ain't leaving he goes he's going to be the president for a long fucking time he ain't going to leave mmm and I was thinking like what does that mean like you have to leave yeah like if he loses he imagine if he loses and he doesn't want he doesn't believe he lost well he's already said he won't believe it he's already said that she's gonna be a revolution  he's yeah he's you know he's laying the groundwork for could be ugly including it the impeachment which would be even worse than him just not getting elected if he was impeached can you imagine what would happen I don't think he's going to get out and peaches he was he's being impeached yeah if he was convicted it was if he's convicted and then removed from office it would be crazy yeah but I don't think that's going to happen I think someone explain to me was it Kyle Dunnigan explain to me how many people what's up no not colleague  count that again did explode kolinsky sorry Kyle Kyle kolinsky who's my favorite online political commentator very wise guys left wing guy but like he calls it like he sees it he's very educated and very aware of all the pitfalls that that is plaguing the left and the right and he said that you would need all these Republicans to vote on it in order for him to actually be impeached and the  not going to there now they're just like twenty two Republican Senators that would have to flip yeah that's a far they have zero then I'm going to flip now the next thing that they're more interested in their party than they are in anything else yeah you have to Republicans they have to stick together they especially in this time where you know look there I'm not a republican but if I was I would be extremely concerned about censorship in social media which is a real thing censorship of  public and ideas and conservative ideas is absolutely a real thing and is it's not just real it's accepted as being the right thing to do by certain organizations I mean they've been caught on camera and hidden camera talking about the ways that you can silence conservative voices you know this is not like so these when you look at social media platforms  they're essentially the best way to get ideas out there right it's even better than Broadcast News because if you put something on Fox or CBS or whatever how many people are really going to watch it is it a thousand a million I mean how many people watch it but if you have a clip that goes viral that clip on YouTube or Twitter where our Facebook wherever wherever that could get 30 million people 40 million people way fucking more than is ever going to watch you want  they've kind of accepted that on late-night television like late night television is kind of accepted that what they're looking for is these clips these moments these clips that almost acts as advertisements for the show yeah you know where it's James Corden fucking making people sing in the car that kind of shit the trying to get these clips that go viral because the show itself you I mean I don't know how many people are watching a few hundred thousand at the most right it's nothing in comparison to a lot of the like like that what's that guy's name that's the famous makeup kid that  he's a gay fellow James Charles that guys videos on makeup get way more fucking views in anything that happens on Fox News and that's a fact yeah anything that happens on MSNBC and that's a fact okay social media is way more potent than anything else and comes to getting a message out and for sure conservatives are being discriminated against on social media by social media platforms well I what's weird about it is that when you think about social media and coming out of silicon  a lie which is famously left wing the election was really swung by the internet in Trump's favor yeah whether or not you want to call them Bots that were set up by Russia or whether or not it was just they were well organized campaign they just they were really smart and very sharp about videos they put out yes they have a thing now where they put out a lot of memes that they encourage people to make memes about yes there are all over Democrats are so far behind or Republicans when it comes to  using using it but you're right I mean if you if you ban certain people from Twitter and from YouTube That's censorship yes it is censorship and even if you're not Banning them from those platforms if your Shadow bending them if you're making it very difficult for people to find them which is real it's a real thing that you do they you know the the way your poet like if you have a post on social media it doesn't just go up in chronological order anymore  now it's affected by an algorithm so I might see your posts or I might not see your post in my feed it's dependent upon what I like and what I watch and what I see when I go to search like if you look at my search feed you know you see you see people beat in the fuck out of each other and girls doing squats looks like my my search it's all like like it's the most cartoonish version of me possible yeah it's all like big bull elk  in and dudes getting head kicked in a muscle car doing a burnout that's my fucking that's all you good look at my Instagram search and that's all affected entirely by this algorithm that figures out what I like yeah and then also recommends things to me like in terms of like there's a lot of sponsored things on Instagram like ooh I could use that as I could yeah no I have to Google is everything good and it's because it's targeting me it's found me that knows that I search for certain things I look at certain things  these are the sites that I follow these are the things that I interact with so let's sell them something and it does the same with you and it doesn't seem to Jamie does the same with everybody so they can in certain social media platforms use that algorithm to discriminate so they can decide hey this fucking guy keeps chirping on and on about Hillary Clinton's war crimes and all this we don't need this guy around okay we don't need this guy and all of his fucking right-wing bullshit and always make America great again  all shits Will Shadow ban them and so they can shove you into this category where it's very difficult to find your find your page and it's very difficult for your shit to show up and a lot of people have seen their views drop drastically their interactions drop drastically because people aren't seeing this shit anymore right Andrew Santino had that happen to him no shit talk to someone talk to someone on the phone that told him he was Shadow band and he's like what does that mean they're like well it  it's because of a post that you made he was well what post is it they wouldn't tell him what post it was what kind of post would it have been as he political know he's like I'm not political at all but you know he's a comic and he says ridiculous shit yeah and he's a redhead and so people probably like you know look at this guy this super white looking guy who says a bunch of ridiculous shit get rid of them yeah off of his head yeah now I had this guy weird fella I think is this handle on Twitter and he used to he used to say stupid  Sherry was Goofy whatever he you know I would interact with him a little bit and then he emailed me at my site to say that he got banned from Twitter remember what remember on Halloween when a kid showed up at the White House and Trump and Milani were standing there and Trump put candy on top of the kid's head instead of handing it to him he's gonna it was like a really ridiculous like this guy can't even just put candy in the fuck kids bag is gotta put it on his head so it was like a thumb that became a meme and this guy just  just wrote I wish the kid had kicked him in The Shins  thrown off Twitter for saying that hmm there's a woman named Megan Murphy she's what's called a Turf do you know what Turf now trans exclusionary radical feminist and she she is one of those radical feminists that don't believe that a trans person is a woman and she was arguing that these people don't have they shouldn't have a voice in women's issues like you're not a woman and so this is her opinion  and some people think that that opinion is transphobic some people think she should be allowed to have that opinion while on Twitter she wrote A man is never a Woman They told her she has to take down that tweet so you know what she did she made a screenshot of it she took down that tweet and then she posted a picture of the screenshot and then they banned it for life Wow you know who's not banned for life OJ Simpson yeah double homicide armed kidnapping hate Twitter world yeah  yeah hey Twitter world is your friend OJ with football picks hey Twitter World he's fine but this lady who's just sad with her words a man is never a woman which biologically is correct band wow do you know what else you get banned for damn you know you will see a band for for Life what dead naming you know dead name is that if you call Caitlyn Jenner Bruce  really and for life no shit yes for life damn ridiculous this is where we're living in this is this political ideology world this is the reason why someone like Elizabeth Warren thinks she has to say taxpayer money should pay for prisoners some fucking mass murderer who decides he's a woman now to get this transition area surgery transition surgery yeah reassignment surgery whatever you want to call it look I wish there was a fucking pill that you could take I wish it was a place  you can go where they zap you like the place where they turn Bruce Banner and the Hulk that turns you into a woman legit 100% Bonafide XY or double X chromosome woman I wish there was I wish there was so this is no argument yeah the argument is in changing someone but not really you know like you're still your chromosomes and your biological makeup and then forcing people to comply so it's a thing of compliance like you're supposed to  not bring up the fact that this person used to be a man look if your name is Greg but like my friend Aubrey okay perfect example his name is to be Chris but he trip balls one day and decide you want to change his name so he changed his name we all just call them off right now I don't call him Chris anymore he was Chris for years I knew him as Chris for years and then he became Aubrey I'm like all right man you want to be Aubrey now your Aubrey I don't give a fuck but if I called him Chris would I be dead name yeah right right but you know what else is  here it is that like the same mentality that says this says that a white kid who grows dreadlocks and dresses in Urban Street where is culturally appropriate yes many many of the people that would sing think that yeah including there's a there was a movement that they had a band I think most people band in it but it's really ridiculous for a while where they were yelling at white girls wearing hoop earrings because they were saying that this is a Latina thing  you're culturally appropriate in that but it's not like then if you historically you got to go back to ancient Sumerians were they invented hoop earrings so you are you from Babylon hmm are you from Mesopotamia no then shut the fuck up because you're culturally appropriate if you do you have a Korean phone in your hand yeah guess what that's culturally appropriate and those Italian jeans culturally appropriate and yeah who made your sneakers huh China what the fuck are we talking about culturally appropriate in is one of the  fucking things because that's what cities are there are melting pots of awesome cultures and they all get together just as if you're a fucking dude and you want to dress up like Bruce Lee that doesn't mean you're culturally appropriate it means you're a Bruce Lee fan and it's kind of cool here admiring that and so you're you're trying to take it on it's all woke it's all woke culture it's this culture of compliance they want you to comply it's all that's what it's about more than anything it's getting people to change getting people to listen to you  and do what you want them to do I want you to stop wearing those fucking earrings I want you to stop wearing dreadlocks meanwhile dreadlocks Romans wore fucking dreadlocks dreadlocks are not necessarily a black thing although most black people like you if there was more rather black people wearing them than white people but there's white people have had dreadlocks forever it's like you can we've all seen dirty hippies with dreadlocks yeah yeah go to a fucking Grateful Dead concert a lot of dirty white people with dreadlocks or not trying to culturally appropriate that trying to be dirty hippies with dreadlocks yeah they're the  as the real to say that that's cultural appropriation is fucking crazy it's great you we all appropriate we all do we all do is you use if you are in the United States in 2019 your part of the greatest Melting Pot the world has ever known and to decide that you can have some of that but you can't have other parts like come on man stop good luck on Halloween Jesus Christ I read this list of things you shouldn't do on Halloween it was like don't put a feather in your head down  output don't even tattoo don't put a tattoo of something that would identify you as Native American or Asian don't have an Asian letters tattooed that was a thing that people used to do so is that a thing you shouldn't do now you can't do that anymore I never was a fan of that to begin with Obama bro you didn't write he may give a speech that's not excellent was great yeah it was it was excellent It's telling people like we're looking to cancel people all the time and this is a perfect quote that he said  the world is messy and it is messy here's what we got to stop looking for things that make you angry and just try try to let things go and just be nice to each other well I thought hard and dialogue these people want to just talk and have you listen like I saw a woman coming out of a fucking restaurant the other day and I was walking in and a t-shirt said I did I don't want to hear or men's stop talking  I don't want to hear from men and it was like I'm sorry did I do something to you have I have I not raised a beautiful daughter and been a loving husband and a great son to my mother and and a great friend to a lot of women and mentored many female Comics that I bring on the road with me and hired when I was head writer on TV shows that I've hired and and it's like don't fucking put me in that category how about we talk about do you have an issue with with you know what's going on with you personally  involving me we'll talk about as a human being right and want as an individual but that's that's the thing they're denying the individual and they're making everything binary it's you and them it's us and them it's 1 & 0 it's not there's no room for nuance yeah this is no is no room for the complexity that is the human race yeah this idea like men should shut the fuck up I don't want to hear from white men that's another one I've seen that shirt I don't want to hear from maybe that's what it was I don't wanna hear it the more drop yeah it's all done  nonsense it's comes from people that want compliance this is the whole thing about what culture is people that felt like they've been pushed around they felt like they've been bullied they felt like they'd been maligned they haven't been treated fairly and now they want to turn it on you and they don't give a fuck they don't give a fuck if you're if you're white man I don't give a fuck what your opinion is shut your fucking mouth and they feel like they can say that because this culture and Bolin boldin's people by letting people get away with nonsense by letting people say things like that like walk into it  if I was on the restaurant someone walked in with shirt like that I'd be like get the fuck out of here just like if you walked into a shirt with a shirt that said black people should shut the fuck up yeah it out right get out get out if you really think that you have no room for black people talking get I don't want you around your mind is rotten you thinking a terrible way go cleanse yourself go yeah go take a fucking meditation class or something figure out what's wrong with you but don't don't bring that toxic energy around people it's stupid yes criminal Tori  well it's half the population and it's like I understand that women have been they've had a different experience than men black people have had a different experience than white people these there's issues that need to be addressed and corrected and enlist me in that yes I'm perfectly willing to Don't Force you right to comply yeah you know there's a there's a giant there's a giant issue in this country that is like like skirted it's like it gets addressed but  gets it gets ignored and the and that is what do they do with all the communities that have been forever affected by slavery like what about all those all those when people talk about reparations  it gets dismissed like it's not you I didn't do anything it's not you it doesn't have to do with you you didn't do anything you never owned a slave I never owned a slave we didn't have anything to do with it but there's no denying that there's parts of this country that are forever affected by slavery and then afterwards by racist laws those red line laws however reconstruction and Jim Crow all that yeah okay never really been addressed never been addressed in terms of a correction now  in terms of like reparations you give people money I don't know if that works like if I thought that by me paying more in taxes and them giving reparations we could ease the tension racial tension this country I would be like okay that's all you have to do but it's not all you have to do right because you're still going to have these communities that are forever affected until something has been done to correct them like I'm not in favor of giving people who were never slaves money as reparations  but I am in favor of giving communities money and figuring out a way to rebuild them figure out a way to make them safer better schools yeah every school lunches Community programs getting people off the streets that are involved in gangs and drugs and all that stuff like I've said this a thousand times but it Bears repeating the best way to have a great country is if we're a team or if we're country were supposed to be a team right where Community a giant community of 320 million people what's the  way to make it stronger well you have less losers that's the best way well what's the likelihood of you becoming a loser if you're in an impoverished drug riddled crime just ravaged area well they're highly it's highly likely that you're not going to succeed in that area unless you are some person of unbelievable character and unbelievable will and fortitude and you're raised by people who did a phenomenal job essentially you know  a war zone right if you live in the south side of Chicago and you look at the murder rate the south side of Chicago and compare it to the murder rate in war zones they're pretty fucking similar right so essentially these people are being asked to do their best and and come out of this war zone and pull themselves up by their bootstraps whereas other people around them are not a war zone if we're Community we're supposed to look at that and go hey how the fuck do you stop this thing from being a war zone how do we stop this how do we how do we do that with Detroit how do  do that with Baltimore how do we do that with all these impoverished areas that that should be addressed well it has to be looked at it is our problems out there problem yes you know we are all living with the ramifications of inequality you know it's affecting us on a daily basis whether it's crime or whether it's you know our gross national product would be much higher if more people were educated and more people were proud of their work and yes and so there's there has to be there has to be Pride less less losers more Pride more  with progress and you know I think if you if you if you live in a certain culture in this country there there isn't a pride in succeeding right there just because you haven't seen it right more opportunity in this includes poor white cultures like I have a friend who's from Kentucky and he tells me about these fucking people that live in these coal mining communities where the coal mining Community the Cole's gone and the community shut down people are hooked on pills and he's like you have never seen  poverty like this he's like you've never seen it we're like everyone in the community is on pills everyone is surviving on like below minimum wage everyone's a criminal like it's just everyone's poor just horrific did you ever see the Wild and wonderful Whites of West Virginia now holy shit I think it's a Johnny Knoxville documentary did he put it together it's amazing it's amazing for all the wrong reasons because these are the trashiest white trash people that have ever lived and they're all on pills  yes they're all turning tricks and doing crazy shit and robbing people and shooting people and it's like the everyone has a fucking story that's like you're like Macaulay Culkin from home alone like what yeah put your hands on your ears like what the fuck but those communities exist they exist they and it's so hard to get out it's so hard to break free like we as a community as a giant 320 million person community should be concentrating on fixing those  that's at least as much as we're concentrating on fixing problems in other parts of the world yeah I understand the logic behind going to these other parts of the world are fucked up and trying to solve these problems before they affect us before they come back to us that's the logic I get it but internally inside of our country we were not doing the same thing we're allowing people to become violent criminals by never giving them a chance but never giving them an outcome or never never giving them a possibilities  he's other than what they see around them not giving them an hour any opportunities and we treat it as if they're supposed to be we're all supposed to be even we're all supposed to be on this even game know some people got one shitty card and some people got like five Aces it does yeah there's this documentary they made about a public school in Chicago I forget what Oak Park I think it was in it was called America is me and it was like this 10 part series and it showed the experiences of the white kids versus the black  it's because it was an integrated school but you were seeing that the black kids were lagging grade-wise graduation rates and they just went in depth and you saw that a lot of the black kids were dealing with single parents they were dealing with being fucking evicted some of them being homeless or just not having the resources like you know the white kids are getting SAT prep classes and you know they're getting extra help because they've got a parent that's not working that can pick them up from school and drive them to a tutor and there's just all these things  is that you're seeing one side is getting Foster in the other side is struggling and it's the same fucking school so it's not it's not as simple as just put good schools in the community but there's got to be mentorship programs and it's got to be the outreach program media outreach has got to be they got to get preschools I got to get kids in there at a young age so the parents can work and there's good nutrition that they say that the studies that show preschool the difference is long term of how people come out of there with those extra two years  his astronomical makes sense makes sense you prep them for it early but it's the thing is this is where a concept like Democratic socialism actually makes sense it's like people think of democratic Socialism or anything when you say the word socialism they go oh you're going to take money and give it to lose you people this is the that's the worst-case scenario right but man if we're Community if we are a community of human beings you gotta we've got to help the people  people that aren't doing good there's got to be a reason why they're not doing good it's not that they're inferior there's they have inferior choices they have inferior opportunities they have an inferior situation and it's so hard to get the mass of people behind giving their money to some sort of some sort of a program that does take steps to fix this you just don't hear it well you know they had the jobs  you know FDR and the New Deal they were able to start people want to work people don't want to get a Welfare Channel they want to feel good about themselves and they and you want to be busy all day you know it was sometimes I'm not suppose I don't work for a month you know I'm between writing jobs maybe I take some time off from stand up I guess I just don't feel good about myself terrible I mean imagine that times year after year and generation after generation and for you it's a choice like if you want to go on the road anytime yeah but that's not a choice for a lot of right for lunch  oyster just fucked and you used to have the the funny thing is like the factory jobs you look back on them and you go those are like really shitty jobs you know I grew up in a factory town and they was like people were not enjoying it people were getting fucking drunk and high and just getting through and now we're looking we're harkening back to like that it was like some golden age of great work like a know you know they were union jobs which was great but let's shoot higher you know let's get weird  actually jobs aren't coming back probably the real question is like some people some people don't have aspirations so if you took someone who's already gone through the school system and you know like oh we're going to get jobs for people that's not good enough well you got to fix the people that are fucked up yeah you can't say like like an 18 year old person is not a finished product right a 25 year old person came from a fucked-up neighborhood and is got all sorts of mental problems  problems and probably PTSD that's not a finished product yeah you can't say we got a job for you will because they're fucked in the head you know they've had a deal with their friend getting shot they have deal with their mom being on crack a getting them a job is not not enough I don't know what the answer is like obviously we're just two white guys talking shit yeah right we don't have to worry about this is not our concern but if you wanted to if you wanted to fix if you were a person like save Greg Fitzsimmons became president how do you fix that how do you how do you even make  steps to fix it because I haven't heard anyone come up with a plan maybe there is one that I haven't heard but a plan where it makes sense where there's a long-term proposition to try to take these communities that are just habitually engulfed in crime and violence just consistently like throughout the 60s and the 70s and and fix it hmm and turn it around like at least try well there's a get the gap between the rich and the poor  or is growing ever since the 80s it's gotten just out of hand you know the amount the top 1% have 50% of the money or something like that and it's just and everything is setup structurally for that to continue to divide more and more right but are they playing a game right they're playing a game called capitalism and that game is their dominating that game and once they get the money then they keep the money and they pass that money down to their kids and they keep the money how do you change that I mean we could all play  a that game right like we could all invest in stock market we can all just really focus entirely on making money or should we not be able to like how do you stop the one percent like these bankers and investment people how do you stop that and how do you stop that in a way where it doesn't seem like you're you know you're changing the rules of the game because some people just psycho good at it and completely dedicated to only making money well you're not changing the rules because the estate  was there from day one the founding fathers wanted there to be a very large estate tax they wanted to avoid what happened in Europe which is these building up of these families that are handing down wealth and so these kids you know so I think we need to go back to right now it's like 35 percent or something like that on wealth over 10 million dollars if you're a couple they need to go back to really taking that money back because the Newton what with it though  put into schools to start with I would love that if there was like a real logic to how that money got spent right right yeah I would be the problem because if it just went to a bunch of like just if it just went to a bunch of government programs that don't seem to make sense and that are really poorly structured that money gets wasted that would make me sick now I think it has to be job training programs it has to be helping small businesses grow with you know low cost loans  but you know the think about these kids that are inheriting a billion dollars what are you ever going to contribute to society as opposed to if you were set up with you went to a private high school you went to a great University you went to a graduate school all of it was paid for you had nannies you were given tutors you should be able to go out and make a good living now yes you don't need that billion dollars right and you will feel so much better if you make your own money yeah so this should be enough money left  left you know I'm not I'm not saying take away everybody's money when they die but I'm saying that there's a grotesque amount of money that needs to be pulled back that's one way of at least putting a chip like chip away at it that's one way right that money yeah what's another way  what's it mean unless you want like cops or police de occupy these areas like how would you ever stop like at this point in time how would you stop places from being crime-ridden it have to be like a multi-step program where you would slowly but surely implement it and try to slowly but surely chip away at all these problems yeah it's not something you're going to fix overnight because it didn't happen overnight you know right right now there has to be great leadership and there has to be a man  you got eight years your president your got four and if you're lucky you get a no I mean local leadership and he tell you know city councilman and you know mayors that are really looking at the community and figuring out and each one's different I feel like if it's that way unless it's federally if it's that way like you're gonna you're dealing with communities that don't have as much money already yeah you know because just by virtue of the fact the crime-ridden and that this is the in poverty-stricken these are communities that are ready to have any money yeah low  tax base go back to talking about farts yes when I find a bump I really bummed out when I talk about people that live in poor neighborhoods that don't have a way out because that is one as one thing that really freaks me out like being stuck like the feeling of being stuck I don't know I mean I don't know what it is about that feeling but it's just you see people in ago I was in Colorado Springs once and I saw this homeless couple they were begging for money they had a fucking baby  had a baby and it was outside and it was kind of cold was like October and I'll never forget that I'm seeing this homeless couple with a baby I'm like fuck they have a baby and they're homeless God damn it like that that kind of shit freaks me the fuck out yeah people who are just doomed you're stuck like your stock your parents are homeless and you're a baby  and usually the parent one of the parents are both of them is mentally ill I mean most homelessness has caused by mental illness know you have do you have addiction which is usually somebody self-medicating to begin with if you got to that point you're usually self-medicating something and it could be a number of things but you know we there used to be  do you had institutional your people that were institutionalized because they needed help yet Mental Hospitals yeah your places where the lowest in our society the most vulnerable were taken care of and those were closed and those people are on the street now that was during the Reagan Administration yeah now in ela we now have typhus yeah that's right literally medieval diseases try making a comeback elos this is back  there's so many homeless people in La they think it might be as many as 70,000 people every night 70,000 people that's what I heard 70,000 and there's not a fucking single plan that makes any sense to deal with that yeah how do I fix that well the part of the problem is that the you know it's just gotten so expensive to live here you know the real estate is gone through the roof and so people are people that were living on the edge you know paycheck to paycheck all of a sudden you're fucking your out you stay on as many  couches you can tell people say look you can't live here anymore yeah and then you're in your car and you know trying to get now you got to get to get back into housing you need to come up with a first last security deposit mmm where the fuck you get in that where are you getting that so we'll definitely happening in some cases and a lot of cases is just drug addicts to write people who are addicted to drugs yeah well one of the things they're finding is that like I work with this group called people concern in Allah and they are trying to get people  people into housing transitory housing where they can at least get a shower get some decent clothes we can go on a job interview and and get started where you don't have to pay that first first last and security deposit that's great if you're not mentally ill right you know if you're mentally ill Saul the showers in the world are going to fix Robert William a pariah for that dude now the other guys it's a guy comes the comic store all the time very nice guy who's a the Olga Perpetual open Miker actually kind of funny got some good one liners but he's  something wrong yeah and those people need to take medication every day when you're on the street you're not getting it and what they require is that you go to a certain facility every day to get your pills they won't give you the pills right these people are fucking they don't know where they're sleeping that night they can't show up at a certain time and a certain place yeah so they need to have plate and one of the things they found also is when they give people housing it used to be contingent on you staying sober and now they're finding that no get them off the street  if they're still using you try to work with them to try to get him into counseling but you don't throw them back out on the street because they're using God fixing people dude fixing people so fucking hard like I did a part of podcast this weekend with Artie Artie Lange yeah he's been sober now for nine months oh yeah yeah he's fucking great his eyes they sparkle he's alive it's great he's right there with you his stories were hilarious story teller out there oh my god dude it was so fun yeah and I  just thinking like you know I was so happy to see him so happy to see him sober crying laughing and thinking God damn it I hope he hangs in there yeah I hope you know I hope that you know they were talking about fixing his nose but you know the doctor was like look he's going to be on pain pills if you fix his Donuts they're going to give him medication like it's too soon yeah yeah he needs at least a year of sobriety before he even thinks about doing that but even then you're taking a guy who's a bona fide Atticus self-professed  addict and then you're going to give them drugs yeah come on I know you can't do it can't do it now that's got to be some painful surgery I would imagine you'd have to have something now you can take it you yeah yeah you're all right I mean meditation can be as effective as any pain killer if you do it right baby I doubt it I don't think so I bet painkillers away better now people are addicted to medication or meditation all right they're addicted to medication not meditation now I'm happy for  really happy for already and I've seen them you know I've said I saw him before he went in and he was a fucking mess yeah really bad and he had been doing good like he was on crashing the two years that I was there and he would come in and the guy was always on time new his lines improved his face off is always fucking great and then you'd hear that he'd gone off again and he was just like man can't you just fucking your so much to offer so smart so talented but he's also a wild man that's one of the  reasons why so funny because he's so impulsive and wrangled you know I mean that's just who already is yeah but God damn he's alive right now he's alive and kicking and his fucking eyes are sparkling yeah like you talk to him he's like hi guys right there yeah he was so funny yeah goddamn he was funny it was just so nice to see him and hug him and when someone has gone through hell and back like that like just just to know that he's still there yeah it's so nice and you know like you know we've lost a lot of people you know we know a lot of people are gone  there were really great people and really funny people just not around anymore mmm they fucked up Geraldo and I mean you know Mitch Hedberg yeah you can just keep going down that list right right you know yeah it's like it is it's that wild they have to find something to replace a I mean Lenny I heard Lenny on your show he was fucking great I mean that guy not that he was ever like a hard addict but he's been sober for a lot of years and he found ways to replace it and still be a fucking man  mad man yeah you know he plays golf like a fucking madman he done he is ever yeah as funny as ever funnier I would say oh my God he's so funny on the podcast yeah he's just rapid-fire yes in his 60s yeah you know it's a wild man yeah yeah I told him to start running I said a lot of addicts they started a these are heels heels I never got that running sigh I remember I ran a little bit I never got that fucking run as I am like he got to run a lot I gotta get in shape and then you do it a lot  get used to it yeah the high doesn't kick in right away there's some layers you gotta shed first but it's goes back to what you were talking about earlier but so many of us are looking for a way to twist our Consciousness to do something to just take you out of whatever the fuck the normal sober Consciousness is yeah what's wrong with the regular sober Consciousness and I mean I'm saying this I'm saying this is somebody who struggles with it yeah I feel all the time like  reaching for something yeah you know even if it's like I took CBD pills this morning just because it changes me a little bit it fucking keys a little a little bit left you know I'm on the road I'll smoke a little pot why I don't know I just need to be different right now I need my head to change yeah well I think it's the monotony of existential angst to it's just like wearing you down you know you look in the mirror you see a few more lines few more bags his skin is just slowly giving away from you  all slowly slowly yeah and we're not going to win this race or no one wins no one wins this thing and that just wears you out sometimes you just want to think about that you have a couple drinks you don't think about any more like 500 Trump don't get hammered yeah see the fights you go to see a game you go to a concert you to drop acid you do something you hit on somebody you would have done that I would have walked up to that fucking hot chick and told her it  a joke that way but like the drinks yeah ladies let me buy you a drink come on I can remember trying to hook up sober after being drunk for so much of my life and then getting sober and then trying to hit on girls and like go to bed with a girl while sober was weird I was looking at my body like this get this shitty but I didn't care about anybody when I was drunk I'd walk to the bathroom naked walk back like dick flopping around once you're sober you're like this is really odd I just met this person  listen I know it's and that even sex like what is that like you're trying to get some sort of a rush out of that you're trying to escape yeah I know you're trying to pulse of you together yeah yeah we're doing something we're leaving this plane you know you're doing something you're trying to trying to escape whatever this fucking monotonous existences together you're seeing her face a woman that an hour before we sitting at a  in a bar may be smiling and thinking to herself always my fight does my smile feel fake or should I be smiling more and now all the sudden she's screaming as she her eyes are rolled back yeah she's in another dimension yeah both of you are yeah and then afterwards you got to deal with each other that is the weirdest thing ever it's like when you really think you're into someone and then you come like oh my god really get out there  how much of it is chemical it's such a fucking trick yeah and women are like I you just did that you just pretended you like me so you could have sex with me no I thought I did like you yeah I was I was tricking myself to like I really believed it if you you know if you say a lot of shit that you don't really mean just to fuck some that's a dirty move but so many guys and I've talked to so many guys who Echo this you really think you like them until you come okay  and then you like yeah and then whatever was kind of cute before now is an annoying and grating on you it's probably the same with women they probably like thought you liked they liked you to you fuck them and then you're hanging around talking and farting and they like get this guy out of my fucking apartment right biology yeah it's the ultimate trick right you are when you're having sex with someone especially if you're really aroused and you they're really hot and you're really into it and they're into you  that is a drug yes it's definitely a drug yeah it's your your oxytocin is through the roof all your fucking pheromones are flying around you smelling each other and you're aroused all your sex hormones are fucking picture yeah blaring you know and it's all it's the number one thing oh yeah that's it I mean we think about thing there's the orgasm and then what second what second in the list of great things that you can experience physically a runners  hi  yeah you know without drugs just that you can naturally experience it's pretty up it's pretty up there yeah  yeah there's not a lot of thing well it's also the the that it's difficult to procure hmm right it's difficult to get someone who's really attractive to like you yeah right I mean it's a reason why you and I are funny yeah right let's be honest like why are why are most men why do they have a sense of humor they have a sense of humor because girls like that and it's a big it's a big one like you can kind of jump through a lot of Hoops he's skip a lot of steps if you're funny yeah if you're a guy and you're funny because you have to be smart to be funny  girls like oh he knows how to be funny yeah you know and if they're not funny but they then you're funny you can make them laugh they're like oh yeah just bring this fucking comedian with me everywhere right and I always have my own little show yeah and when she likes you because I like oh she likes me because I'm funny and I'll get funnier yeah work at this yeah be good at this dude when I was in 6th grade me and John your Zach used to do comedy routines for the girls at lunch and we had whole fucking routines like you know like Marx Brothers stuff and Muppet Show shh  shit like whatever worked we were up there tap dancing for those girls and they luck Vicki Batman and the rag they loved it so funny and I remember that feeling back then because I was too skinny little kid with red hair and freckles no chicks took they just cared about the guys that were good at sports and all sudden like I'm getting laughs and and I just remember feeling like this is what I want to do this is this is what I need to do yeah you found like you yeah  so this is that right it's like when guys see a car like a brand-new Mercedes in a commercial and as a girl with long legs and high heels and she's leaning against the car like oh my God is that girl come with the car if I get the car while I get her yeah I need to get her it's hard to get one of those you get a girl with long legs and high heels and beautiful lips and she's looking at you like she loves you that's so difficult to find so difficult to get most of the time those girls they look right they walk right by you like you don't even exist look at that if I get that watch that why  there's a girl staring at that watch loves that wad gotta get that watch and that's like what's used to sell most things like how many things in America in particular are sold by attractive women yeah attractive women in ads attractive women like that we associate if you get this Lamborghini attractive women will be more drawn to you because it's difficult to get a Lamborghini all right this guy can get a Lamborghini that means he's got $300,000 to throw  on a stupid car that's probably going to break down yeah Jon Hamm doing those car ads women fucking they want to get in that car with John am Matthew McConaughey look at him look at him look at that house he lives in IQ be in that house I just need to know if I meet him he'll love me I would put a couch over there though it's not enough it's not enough Shrubbery inside the house I fix it kind of a modern painting it just needs a woman's touch then he has sex with and he's like I gotta go  but I thought but it's your house we are forever yeah the the ultimate biological trick if they ever see that's what's going to be really weird like if you look at aliens right what's the the iconic alien they have the big heads they have these little boy like bodies long fingers no dicks yeah there's nothing there right because that's probably what happens in the future yeah the future we all figure out listen we are being tricked left and right by our dicks  us and our vaginas and our sex hormones are talking us into nonsense when we could just be enlightened and we could travel the Galaxy together but we got to get past all this sex stuff this biological sex stuff and you can you can have an orgasm in your own brain here with your list new phone iPhone 72 yeah and just press the button and they get that out of your system good now we don't need sex anymore yeah and we don't need our mouths either we need to talk with our brains just you know big giant head with tiny slit for a mouth mmm  like remember that Woody Allen movie sleepers and they have the orgasmatron oh yeah and you just pass it around and then you have an orgasm and then you move on that was it you mean you think about how much work is involved in trying to get an orgasm like how much energy people spend and then though the seduction right you meet someone at a bar can I buy you a drink okay let me like that cigarette you can't do that anymore but that was a thing right like light the girls cigarette by a  drink oh he's so Charming oh oh thinking maybe dance is not a mating dance let's dance watch me shake my hips I'm going to look as you know how to dance a guy who doesn't know how to dance probably sucks and bad yeah that guy can fucking dance and dance but I'm sure one in me it's time to breed I'm going to breed with a conqueror a man who could dance in those are the light a cigarette he could kill somebody for me he's big he's big  knows how to think he knows that we gotta get out of here troubles Brewing he's a protector woman again is nice car I can drive fast woman lives in top of the hill whoo he's got a good spot we can see the enemies coming from the long way that's right yeah so weird people I mean that's our business is like getting people to like us right as a big part of what our business is our business is like saying  I'm funny shit so people like us yeah another people do different things like some girls they just work on the squats you know just go to the gym a lot so the people like them more than a sticks out more get more attention  all right some people just funny some people they acquire thing some people acquire Power Respect influence yeah which I watch this nature special on the what are those animals that hang upside down in Australia  that's now they're like furry their furry and cute wallabies no bounce around for you what they're called but wombats now they got they've got them I got them here too I think but anyway this motherfucker is on one side of the river and he can hear a mating call from the other side of the river and he's slow as shit sloth sloth it's not so this God here's the female sloth and he fucking they and I don't know where they get these cameras from but they watch this guy go down  the tree across a limb into the water can't swim for shit this fucking Rapids he makes his way across all the logs he can hear that gets across climbs on it takes like two days and then he finds this other spot and he climbs on top of her a couple shakes of the head yeah who's this bitch but now he can think now the girl little guy can think about Jesus she wants to eat my fruit fuck out here it's my fruit bitch  so let's talk about that star that was shining last night because I was entertainment back then but what it's a even weirder dance for a girl because a girl has to figure out whether or not this guy is going to be around right she's going to let this guy shoot one inside of her and then what if she gets pregnant and now this asshole she has to rely on him and what is he going to be around is he gonna sloth-like she can't she like there's a going to be a lot of time or she  dedicate to taking care of this kid maybe she can hold that down a full-time job maybe she can't but there's a lot of fucking resources that need to be dedicated towards raising these children is someone going to help am I going to be doing this on my own like women have to be really fucking careful really careful imagine if guys got pregnant every time we fucked mmm oh my God yeah I had a joke about that abortion would be an app on your phone because it would like if we got pregnant  the fuck out of here oh yeah yeah morning-after pills would just be on the bedside table every morning they'll be everywhere they give them to you at hotels like they leave mints on the bed yeah chocolates yeah leave fucking Plan B pills there would be no kids zero kids had to be two of us women love children they're nurturing you're capable yeah we're like some women but some women don't want to get boxed into that either yeah which is in some guys don't want to get some guy look I love  no father I know you love being a father but we all have friends that have like a bunch of them that have vasectomies they don't want to have kids fuck that yeah okay that's okay that's all okay there's plenty of people it's great that you know you don't yeah I mean I don't even know if you know you don't because maybe you think you don't because you haven't had it I mean a kid will change the way your fucking brain works yeah and a lot of times for the better it made me a way nicer person yeah way nicer and made me way more considerate of people's positions to  because I used to think of people always as being static like oh this is Greg he's 52 he's always been 52 this Woody is I mean I know him and talk to him right now now I look at people and I go oh Greg he's to be a baby he was a baby like what did how did what what what weird circumstances befell him what fucking weird pitfalls and traps and weird things entered it to his life what weird people fucked him over what weird people lied to him stole from him  what how did he get to be This Bitter person right now hate to use your name there I didn't mean yeah fine come on big guy you're not I realize halfway and I've created a scenario that's wholly unlike you but you know it's I think of people now in a different way I used to think of people angry people used to think of them as I'll fuck that idiot but now I go all that fucking guy he got he got fucked over yeah they got fucked over that's the most of them nest of them got fucked over that could have been me it'll be me easily or just have a bad chemical makeup you know some people are just  fucking ADHD I think that they're not caring friends because they don't remember to call you whatever it's like that guy's trying to get his shoelaces tied yeah or maybe he's OCD and he can't wait to wash his hands again or maybe he's got Alzheimer's and he can't remember whether he washed his hands you don't mean this most people are trying their best yeah and I think a big part of what's wrong in this world is that we're dealing with a lot of communication that's not face to face a lot of them a lot of it  whether it's you know he said she said shit we're like you know you have a problem with this guy and then another guy tells you he said some shit about you what did he say fuck that guy he said that I'll tell you what really happened instead instead of like you being alone with that guy well what happened what do you think happened what I think happened is this and that you like well that's definitely not what happened because of this and then he's gonna go oh I didn't know that well I didn't want it I don't know I'm didn't want to fuck you over I'm not trying to fuck you over hmm well I thought you were okay  well now I understand why you were behaving the way you were behaving well could bullets We're Men here let's talk you know like I don't like I don't want any enemies I want friends or let's yell a little bit till so yeah let's figure this out but so much of today that is excluded from the formula so much of today is people dealing with emails like how much can be like I had to put out a fire between two friends in an email recently or one person was upset upset  because they thought some person was doing something shitty to them I'm like no no no that's not that's not what happened like okay let me explain I'll do my best but there's a whole reason everyone anyone's having this conversation is because you guys weren't talking in front of each other you know and then there's this Wonder like how is that guy what is he saying about me when I'm not around what has he feel about me did you feel like you got over on me does he feel like he did he fuck me over did he disrespect me  so much of it is like we're not supposed to communicate any other way other than like you and I are doing right now look at each other in the eyes I know you're not full of shit you know I'm not full of shit and we get to talk that's how people are supposed to be in a little village where you know you just if you had a problem you talk to that person and if you were a shitty person if you are acting shitty everybody knew you were shitty yes and you got a little bit ostracized for it yes yes definitely there was correction and gossip was healthy a little bit  suppose good it was good it was like going hey that's Bill he rapes yeah that's the gossip today this guy likes to get 5 pounds of ground beef stuffed up his ass right hey I don't know why you need to fart because Johnny over there he'll give you five bucks if you fucking throw it in his face he likes it what yeah he's gonna beat off while you fart that's it that's what he likes he does want you to touch him  just fart in his face and then kick him in the balls you know he's feeding her watch those videos of guys that like they liked it and yeah I say that I mean they really get kicked in the ball like hard Saddam I from that guys get their balls stomped with Stilettos that's a really common thing stomped a guys lose testicles yeah I know a guy lost a testicle because you got kicked and he didn't have a cup on and he was sparring just like he's like I'll do one more round so he Spa  is any gets slammed in the fucking sack with a shin and he's testicle burst  burst  these guys are just letting some chicks stomp on them with a stiletto heel yeah as fucking around with Dave Vada one time when I was in like tenth grade and we were wrestling around and he reached down and grabbed my balls really hard and squoze I'm like a fucking night was a little bit of a nut and I remember laying on the ground for like 10 minutes being in like the most severe pain I've ever been in my life  dude I thought it was sterile for a long time because he getting kicked in the balls I've been kicked in the balls it least a hundred times hard by black belts like I've been kicked in the balls dude like many many many times they try to kick in the balls no no you Clash yeah like say if you're throwing a kick with your right leg and I'm throwing a kick with my right leg we throw them at the same time and you just were moving weird sometimes it just goes right in the sack yeah sometimes a  will deflect you know like someone will be hitting you and you're trying to hit them in the chest but inadvertently they catch part of your leg and it redirects it right towards their balls cups don't really cover your balls that's the they do new ones do yeah they all want there's a there's a new well there's a company called Diamond MMA and I wear their cup when I do Jiu Jitsu and it's a compression short with all these straps built in and it's cup that it's got like  more flexible foam rubber rubber on the outside and then a very hard rubber that covers the like the outside edge rather and a very hard rubber that covers like those sack and then the dick and then it fits very snugly to your body and you could you can get kicked in the balls pretty hard with wow yeah it's a giant Improvement yeah but when I was a kid we didn't have that now we had a cup that slid into a jockstrap and a barely held in place and one time I was  tournament and I got kicked in the ball so fucking I was pretty sure this guy did it on purpose he was he was a mean fuck I was fighting this Korean dude he was very good and very mean and I'm pretty sure he kicked me in the balls on purpose because I punched him in the face on purpose right afterwards I was pretty sure yeah but my ball my cup slammed into my ball so the cop did worse than protect me then not protect me it actually became a weapon against my ball  right so the cup slammed into my ball my ball swole up it was awful it was so it was what were those cups protecting pretty much your shaft but not your ball they do protect your balls a little bit under the ideal circumstances like something comes at it straight on and it hits the cup it's way better the hit the cup than it is to hit your balls by themselves it's definitely better but take a bicycle helmet they made Taekwondo cups that we used to wear on the outside that we're even better because you wear them you do  your your pants on you're like your GE pants and then you would put the cup on over the pants and it was there were like more sturdy and they would tie on they would hold them in place it was a little more material there so it's like it would cover your your junk better yeah but still  Sac is it's a fucking terrible design it is a bad design outside dangling in midair just waiting to be hurt if you ever sit on your ball oh yeah oh yeah you ever cut your dick in a zipper no never know oh my God we're underwear that's done I'd gone fucking Commando before my dick in his ever yeah he's like the crown know the shaft somewhere in the the side of the shaft I caught in the zipper it was  eating no sex for a while after that because then you have to explain yeah like what's on your dick fucking caught in the zipper you fucking liar you fucking like you're gonna give me a disease just such a piece of shit that's why they invented button fly yeah probably right well I think butterfly was first was it yeah I think the old device I think they were all button fly they had figured out zippers yeah like zippers like a list guess when you think  I invented the zipper  I want to say like the 1800s yeah I think the I thought the original Levi's jeans had zippers don't think so now I think the originally I think that's why they call them the original button fly right like 501s usual 501 jeans yeah button flies I remember dry humping I was a fucking dry hump were in junior high school man I'm a machine dude I would go all night I would get it I was I was gifted and you know Yugi you try to get your cock right  right in the middle there right in the spot and then I was perfect and I remember one time getting a scab I got so raw at a scab on it Jesus yeah did you not from dry humping a couple times but I was pretty restrained we got a if you dry hump the right way to do it is with silk pajamas oh no wonder where nice right you see guess I could go back in time yeah we talked to my old self  hey dickhead you're gonna get some corduroy is you showing up at some girl's house she's in eighth grade dad answers the door why are you wearing silk pajama pants I'm just really into so read a lot about trade China is Irene here she comes down where are you wearing underwear you piece of shit what  huh you think I'm stupid I'm married I have children all right I've had sex you little fuck I know what you're doing you want to dry hump my kid hmm she comes down she's wearing silk pajamas the fuck is going on here no way can I yeah dry humping man good old days yeah number you grab a tittie or so happy can't believe him holding at it outside the shirt I was yeah yeah outrageous yeah you're so happy like this  is so much better than not holding at it yeah it's as good as it gets and then if you if you were a girl I felt bad for girls back then because how annoying when it be that somebody's just grabbing know what you're talking about call me right now that you just grabbing their tit and you can't stop like your she's got a Braun you wedged your hand under her bra and you just grabbing just squeezing yeah that's not pleasurable for her no  definitely not but they did it maybe she didn't like it maybe she's like the fact she's naughty yeah so naughty I couldn't fathom that girls were enjoying fooling around for a long time I really thought that they were just do being nice to I couldn't imagine the girls like boys like why do you even like me yeah like why do you like boys boys are so gross yeah you know I remember being a kid thinking that man I'm so happy the girls like boys  don't understand it he doesn't make sense why would they like us we don't it's we don't have any of the good things that they have yeah they have tents at the it wet  we're ready were dirty gross they were makeup we don't they're gross we're stupid there were dumb as fuck if we are Dumber To like the whole process of men developing and getting testosterone and going through the whole cycle of adulthood it's just a fact that women mature quicker

spoon.com / Jo my guest today is really a fascinating human being I really enjoy talking to him he's a an iconic actor you might know him from American History X or from Fight Club but he's got a new film coming out right now it'll be out November 1st it's called motherless Brooklyn he wrote it he  directed it he acts in and he's one of the producers of it is a real love project and it was fascinating listen to him talk about his craft and I don't use that word lightly with him I really it is a craft and this movie sounds fucking amazing and I just again I can't say enough how much I really enjoy talking to me is a fascinating guy please welcome Edward Norton  The Joe Rogan Experience trained by day Joe Rogan podcast by night all day good start when I meet a fellow Lenny Bruce fan yeah yeah that was a I and I you know there's that line in Fight Club the things you own end up owning you and I generally am not a stuff guy but when I came in here I did find myself going this is the right kind of place to keep stuff yeah and I was I've been  around looking at things and that was my favorite thing that I saw you have that a couple of the great Lenny Bruce posters yeah one of which I've never seen which one although that one with his we're here it's really wild he looks like an Indian Guru or something yeah staring into the middle distance that's that's an amazing to photograph him yeah I kind of bought as much vintage Lenny Bruce stuff as I could find this place has sort of evolved into a semi Gallery you know it's I would like to have a house with nothing  in it and then have this place just filled with shit no I kind of grew the also I think that it's fun when you have people come through a space so that you're actually like sharing the things like this sort of like you're letting and someone come in and wander mmm some of the best museums in the worlds are people's individual curations on the best art collections ever made are better than any Museum because they're put together by someone and you're finding like the threads and things yeah so I think when you can when you can assemble like things  I meant something to you but you can put them in a space where other people can bump into them it's better than just like then letting them just collect dust in your own home where they you stop looking at them you know you have a very unusual perspective for someone who makes a living as an actor what do you mean why do you think so you're very thoughtful person very thoughtful I know a lot I know a lot of thoughtful act I do too I do too yeah but it's not common you gotta find them you got to curate those folks yeah I  it's a funny it's a funny it's a funny gig by like by definition it's like if you think about all the like the yin yang and at the paradoxes and it's like on the one hand with guys as actors there will be a lot of you know there's a certain kind of not not Macho but there's like you know men will look to play intense roles and write these things but what you're doing is like it's it's you're playing dress up like you know  you're like and I always like I was like the Dorothy Parker the famous New York you know writer said scratching actor you'll find an actress I think it's the greatest line it's not and it's not how it sounds just be a little you know like maybe see if that's not enough knock on actresses no no more of him but that's the real truth of the whole thing is like we put on makeup we put on clothes we play dress-up and we pretend to be other people and it's like  like it really is like you know when people are like you know sometimes my brother and sister will laugh because I've done these certain things that have a certain kind of iconic intensity or whatever ready like and they look at me and they're like are you kidding like you've seen the size of his ankles he they're like my brothers like he's such a twerp like he's such a he's my brother's like two inches bigger than me and 30 pounds bigger and way stronger you know my little brother and he's and it's always like  he is the he's a theater nerd he cannot like tough they're like don't let you play the Hulk yeah no but um or American history history x' I do but I do I do think there's  there's sometimes there's a it's really funny the way there's a posture in it sometimes there's like a pot there's like a public-facing posture that some people who are in this trade this weird thing will adopt and it's like it's like hey man I hate to tell you but like like you don't have to live in to some you don't have to live into it I sometimes feel like people are compensating for the fact that what they do in fact he's played dress-up right do you think it's also that they have to kind of  project this image to ensure that they get more of these tough guy rolls or maybe maybe I don't know I don't know I think or or maybe it's like that's who they wanted to be maybe in a weird way they're living in to some people I think they they relish the opportunity to change the story of who they are you know what I mean they're there  they're they're getting to through through getting well-known they're getting this chance to sort of like wipe the Slate yeah of whatever it is they were getting away from and they're getting to you know the chance to sort of create a create a Persona that they're they're happier with them than what then before you know right look what they wish they always were yeah and their darkest times yeah or or  you know yeah there's there's a  I also think there's a funny thing which is there's this history of famous actors right so when it and it I do think it it sort of begins with Brando because Brando had such an enormous effect on the psychology of men in America he really really liked and if you look at what I would call like the great generation of American actors the Dustin Hoffman Robert De Niro Robert Duvall Gene Hackman Al Pacino Morgan Freeman Meryl Streep like this you know the whole poem  it's all like the post Brando Generation all of those people literally all of them want to become actors because of Marlon Brando and and he he so rewrote the idea of what it was what it could be that you have got a whole it was like what Bob Dylan did in in the culture it was like it rewrote like it just rewrote the game almost like what Lenny did with calm yeah absolutely Lenny Bruce and got there and not and there are these people  who come and they have they have like a kind of us a permanent there are permanent before and after yes in a certain kind of field you know what I mean Hendrix with the guitar heh yeah yeah yes I would say so I would say so in rock guitar area although it is interesting when you go back and look at Rock in that era there's that famous story of I think of I don't remember if it's like Pete Townshend making Eric Clapton come with him to your hand yeah clapping  crying yes you know about it yeah I heard that story but you can't but you also can't discount a classic Clapton in in you know there's those famous photos of the wall Clapton is God like like deers it's hard to like you can't really under rate what Clapton did to guitar and guitar you know in that era to write know he was phenomenal but it was a different thing it was a different thing Jimi Hendrix was was a protein he seemed like he broke through to  a new dimension yeah I can figure through the membrane of existence into this a new sound and there's guys that are like there's people that have a distinct set like Gru a Gary Clark jr. fan no I can't Gary Clark jr. is of phenomenal blues guitarist okay and he has a sound that's almost instantaneously recognizable as Gary Clark jr. you hear me you go oh my god there it is like everyone who works at them is just like they just walk away sweating  Scott Jesus Christ well it's phenomenal I feel that way about Willie Nelson I think Willie Nelson is legitimately in country music like there's before and after Willie Nelson like and and you can say that he you know that Hank Williams jr. whatever that he but Willie Willie Nelson to me is the hinge around which it goes from being something that had you know then it had a Nashville kind of Grand old Opry kind of Polish to it and he basically took it he reclaimed  aimed it in as this like American Roots hmm thing and put jazz in it that's what's so crazy is people anyone who plays music knows like Willie Nelson is essentially a jazz guitar player like and and he you know redheaded stranger is to me that's a before-and-after kind of a thing to like there's that out that whole Outlaw thing and I think there's a whole lot of  it's almost like after that there's two camps there's still going to be like the you know the Steve role in his Copperhead Road thing is more positive thing but then there's like Steve roll Roots Steve Earle you know what I mean it's like he almost like straddled it but but my point about Brando was just that like he  he changed the he changed the idea of the type of person that male actors wanted to be they want and suddenly it was like they wanted to have like a patina or a reputation as a visceral they wanted to be visceral not polished they wanted to be muscular they wanted to be masculine they wanted to be you know intense like those were not the kind of words  that people when you think back on like Jimmy Stewart Cary Grant like that that is not what right that is not what movie stars were aspiring to they were aspiring to polish a kind of a Polish before Brando and I was an author recipes right yes there's a something there's something to his performances where you go oh well this is more like real life than a fit like on the waterfront like the the I could have been a contender thing yeah like when he's doing that you like well the oh this is how someone would actually  behave if they felt like their life had been a disaster and it could have been avoided well you just hit on something know that and drives me nuts because when people sort of talk about Brando they're like you know they're sort of the like the Stanley Kowalski the the brutal masculinity Etc the thing about Brando isn't he is beautiful he's and he's kind of this enormous Roman looking guy but it's eat where he  kills where he really kills his this kind of broken sensitivity that he had and I could have been a contender is not a tough guy speech it's the opposite it's a broken tough guy it's a guy practically crying saying like you were my you were my brother and you should have looked out for me I needed you looking out for me and my life is my life's gone down the toilet because of that in that moment you didn't look out for me it's you know it's like tearful it's not and and Even Steven the best moment of Stanley Kowalski  all ski and streetcar is is really it's like when he falls on his knees in front of his wife and cries you know what I mean it's like that's what he he was way better in in a lot of ways to me it's the fact that he was actually kind of in touch with his emotional life it's not that he was ranked so Macho right all its that he he looked that way but he was but he actually had this like Poetic sensitivity yeah  yes and it was it resonated real like it felt real yeah and if you watch actors before him there was a certain undeniable theatric element to what they were doing that was like oh this guy's acting yeah whereas he was he seemed like a guy who was really living the scene yeah yeah and some of it sometimes I think it sounds like say that instrument of a person but he has this crazy  he's he looks the way he looks but he's got this marble-mouthed he does he not articulate he doesn't come off as like there's a machinist to the way he speaks and kind of a yeah it doesn't have style you know the guys before that it was you felt their her you felt that they were working on their style yeah and and he seemed to be sort of like scratching his ribs and and mumbling and  and you know in a T-shirt and he just was he kind of present in the moment I think it was all accentuated by the way he ended his life like the end of his life he was enormous yeah gigantic fat guy and he just it just given into all of his vices and he was just this guy he did he was a beautiful man yeah he just didn't seem to give a fuck about that at all  yeah I think he said something to me one time about how how much he was enjoying his life when he was like 23 and and he's like I had you know even when he was doing the play streetcar that made him famous he was telling me like he would get with his pal Diego and go up to Harlem go to clubs and hit on girls and all these things and he and I said you weren't aware of what was going on you know and he goes well there was I was aware of a certain amount of noise rising and then one day I woke up and I  sitting on a pile of candy that's what he and and I thought what a really wild way to say it and I do think I'm not even joking to me it's like what you said it was like after that they were just it was like there was no boundaries he was like the gate he was getting every everything was  he wasn't gonna be able to resist he wasn't disciplined he wasn't a super disciplined person he was very poetic person I've and I don't think he was disciplined and I think that a lot of what happened you know he had like something like 17 children and and he got you know he had appetites and he had these things and I think that  I do think that he you know struggling struggled to  to deal with all the things that came with being that famous you know and being that famous when there wasn't really a lot of examples of how to do it right or wrong before you yeah I'm sort of the Elvis thing right it yeah it's the Elvis thing that the flip is like Dylan who I still find myself like when you watch the new Scorsese have you seen that thing rolling rolling thunder it's really worth watching that  or the original Scorsese doctor about him one no direction home like here's this guy he's like in his early 20s and they're coming at him with all this like voice you Generation all this stuff and he's like that's nothing I can relate to man you know and he's and he's going like I can't help wondering if Lenny Bruce loved Dylan he my don't know that but I would think that Lenny Bruce was tuned in the Dylan because Dylan's thing was like don't ask me what it means man I wrote it I you know I  what it means what you think it means he was just constantly going buzz off man I'm not picking it apart for you I'm not I'm not going to pick it apart for you I'm not going to like buy into this stuff you're putting at me and how did he he was twenty twenty twenty one years old like who resists who resists people falling all over them to call them great when they're that age nobody right nobody has that kind of like building sensibility to go everything you're bringing it me is  going to be bad for me and I it's like watch the if you watch those interviews with him when he's that age it's pretty astonishing because to your point like you're like a thoughtful act whatever I look at him and I'm like nobody has that discipline at that age yes amazing how uniquely qualified he was for that position at that point in time and that very strange tumultuous time in history as well and not only that right at the moment that that like Joni Baez brings him out on the stage at the Newport Folk  festival and basically goes this is the prince this is I anoint you he's the one he's Neo he's the he is the one and the next year he doesn't even take one year to go to go let me just let me just lean into your love the next year he comes with an electric guitar and plugs it in at the Newport Folk Festival and people start screaming in agony like going what are you doing like you're Bob Dylan you're the king of folk you can't  plug in a guitar and people are like running to try to cut his cords with an ax in this thing like that's how much of a betrayal and he's like there's people yelling traitor at him and he's going I don't believe you you know I think you're a liar like and he's turning around Robbie Robertson and going play it Loud I mean the guy is so punk rock wow he's so totally punk rock he he was his punk rock as anybody ever I think he probably had to be just to resist what they were trying to box him into yeah and by but there's never been anybody who was  more like oh you like what I'm doing I'm gone I'm over here like enjoy you're gonna not like it because you like what I just did now where I'm going you're going to be discombobulated and upset and eventually you're going to catch up and then when you catch up I'm going to move on to something else like it's really it really is amazing is amazing because how many people do you know in any of the things we all do who get a taste of the thing and don't like lean into it for a while right like who don't kind of go  this feels good you know maybe I'll just hang out right here and well it's always weird when you see somebody leaned into something and it's not really them and they become what people want of them you know and yeah you like a great example in comedy was kinnison kinnison when he made it everybody wanted to lay these gigantic lines of coke form apparently they like how it's him it's him he's here to put right there just laid some giant line  can you joke around about it like I had to do it and you know you do you know a giant line yeah I can't fucking heart attack right I can't not live in writing thing because then then yes they'll stop trusting it all right right but you become a caricature yeah come this thing like dice Clays another example like Dice Clay used to be that used to be one part of his act his name is Andrew Andrew Silverstein so he would do his act and then the Dice Man was a character that he would do but people loved it so much when we would do that  that character that the character became his whole act and then he became the character where you see him in real life he's wearing like weightlifting gloves and you know walking around a Gold's Gym t-shirt he became that guy he's hilarious still but he's that guy now but that's kind of out the backside of that when you say in what way well now he's like acting and thing does do that is one and not well yeah but he still does the same kind of stand up really if you go see him it's still hilarious irreverent  just completely not of this era well let me ask you a question because I think it's interesting I think in that vein like if you look at Howard Stern who I've met only a couple times but I had I found him to be like the extremely extremely thoughtful guy like and I don't mean that he just was very very intelligent really smart and that's again but he's also like  I don't know the conversation we have mutual friends and I and I and I really enjoyed talking to him like I thought I thought like others nothing tricky about him at all he's really like down in his shoes he's interested he actually asked question I mean it's some people you meet and you're just like oh my God that you're they're talking in a mirror that you're a mirror and they're just looking at themselves while they speak to you they're waiting for you to get done talking to them talk yeah but he but I think what I think is really interesting is like so Howard  imagine imagine the pressure because I grew up in the Baltimore area he was on DC radio he was on DC 101 I remember I remember that the shock him literally and imagine you know the pull to deliver on what you've built which was obviously you know a huge audience that wanted this thing to me it's really interesting and impressive that  Howard's kind of and I'm saying like I know and I don't know him but watching it to me this idea that he's kind of said hey look I you know I'm I'm going to be honest about where I'm at and in some measure I'm going to say there's things I've done I regret there's ways of treated certain people in the interest of the show that I'm kind of I'm kind of done with that I don't really want to be that guy and in some measure you know he kind of saying Joe  seems like you got to deal with me where I am now yeah you know what I mean now like it's not like there's like a huge risk in that because his audience is gigantic right what's also he's so successful and so universally praised as being the most important figure in the history of radio like there's no one who does like what I do podcasts and there's no a gigantic debt of gratitude to Howard Stern the fact that you know he was getting fined by the FCC me I mean they were hundreds of thousands of dollars he kept getting fired from radio stations  I kept doing that doing it the way he did it it changed the way people do talk radio honestly the fact that we can even the fact that we've talked as long as we've talked up to now is a function of him proving that there was a tolerance for long-form basically you know what I mean I mean it's like people knock on Netflix or whatever I'm like I'm like anything there's an amazing thing going on in the world right now which is people are people are re re  proving or reconnecting with the fact that for all of what goes on on Facebook and Instagram and Twitter and all this bullshit like the truth is people people like and have the appetite for and their brains enjoy longer form conversations yes and longer form stories more than than it was assumed they did you know what I mean and like popular culture feeds us a lot of like fast food and Xanax in like a speedball  of of you can't handle anything you don't want anything more than than literally like a little bit of junk food with a little bit of Xanax cause you just want to lie on your couch and watch someone else save the world that's I know that's all you want but that isn't that is not true and I think like you know you look at things like like from peaky blinders to Chernobyl to like the Ken Burns Civil War series like we're going through this thing where people are realizing like no that's not actually true people actually  you my pal Dax you know Shepherd who's got a great radio show people like to listen to people have actual conversations well they're also listening it's a new way of ingesting entertainment like you're getting it in your car you're getting it in your ears when you're at the gym yeah well you're on the subway or bus or plane and it's you're getting the stimulating long-form conversations that maybe maybe people didn't even know they wanted  you know yeah I agree I agree buddy-buddy a great conversation with someone so it's like you get to have that conversation without participating right right and and and Stern definitely was like we talked about before and after like II there was talk radio but that but it kind of starts there I think I think you you started to be like I can listen this guy for a long time yeah he broke through the membrane like you're talking about Hendricks entering into a new dimension of sounds he broke through the membrane of talk radio and  what he's doing now is will now he's a man in his 60s who's extremely wealthy and he has some I'm sure some regrets as you were talking about the things that he's done in the past and said in the past and he's also like this is who he is now he's not going to pretend right that he's just wants to bring strippers in and have them ride the city and every day and when people get upset that he's changed well I hope you change to man yeah I hope everybody changed that's why I mean I admire I mean true it's true it's not quite Dylan when he's 24 and being annoying  pointed plugging in a guitar but I do think it's when people sort of go hey I'm gonna I'm gonna be where I am yes and and you got to deal with it right that's positive I think well it's definitely better than leaning into it and being what people want you to be and be struggling with that and tortured by that I actually think most of the most of people who I think that mostly ends up badly yes yes yeah I think whenever you don't go with  have you actually are and whenever you don't acknowledge that whoever you actually are has changed you know if you're growing and learning and having these epiphanies and these realizations about yourself and where you fit into your own life and how you've interacted with people in your life you're not making adjustments and you're only doing it that way because you think that's what people expect of you your prisoner to your own first Incarnation yeah you know the first thing that people saw and that was kinnison's ow he's a kind of a  runner to that forever yeah it acknowledged it yeah it's why it's why anybody who  and it's not even act to anybody anybody who's who couldn't who keeps doing interesting things through phases is even more impressive yeah that's also is it hard as an actor two of you you get an iconic role and then you are sort of always remembered for being that guy in that thing like how much of a is is it a hard transition to go from an iconic role to go  into your next role of people still want to talk about the the big movie that you were in just a year or two ago mmm it's never that hasn't been a big thing for me I  I think  I take I tend to take a bit of time between things and also  I don't know when I you know like the first thing I did kind of popped off pretty hot and then and then everyone's like sending me like this you know it's like psychotic right psychotic interesting characters I was like well I think I'll do a musical with Woody Allen you know what I mean and I wear a plaid jacket and yeah do a dance number and Harry Winston's like like what's up yeah or and  and then what's really weird is I didn't at first I did a played this lawyer I played a young lawyer in the Larry Flynt film right which an alpha that I got I get this distinct Vibe of like hey the next John Grisham movie is like the way you were talking and court and that movie you would kill and is John Grisham thing is the young lawyer or whatever and and I remember I met Francis Coppola was going to direct The Rainmaker this Grisham  and I was up for it I didn't get it Matt Damon got it and I didn't do some ballsy thing and like say that's not for me I was like I was like Francis Coppola died like I want this you know ya think but I when I was talking to him about it and thinking to myself a little bit like this seems a little square but it's like Francis Coppola you know what I mean and it's like and and he when I was talking to him about it he was like well what you know what are you in true what are you working on what you  interested in and I was telling him about my friend David who had written this American History X and that we were working on as kind of telling him what we were trying to do with it and how he wanted to make it is this kind of like gorillas you know thing and he was like you should do that you should do that immediately and I was like well I wanted I was like don't don't touch I was like don't cancel them don't don't you know I still want to do this with you he's like no no I think you should do you like the way you're talking about that and he said if you do that  now they'll never don't never know what to do with you like they'll never be they'll never be able to put you in a box kind of because that's just you know if you pull that off and I kind of was like you know it I did have an agent at the time it was really old school really funny and he was kind of like he don't understand that he was like he was like find something big let's find something big big director big film big franchise whatever  / and I remember thinking like nah I think I'm going to do this and and we knock that off and the funny thing is you say well is that becoming trap it that wasn't a trap that was like a Liberation it's almost like doing that part it was like a permanent Hand Grenade on it was like net it was like well we never know what to expect now right so it's it becomes like Liberation on his at a certain point because like I weigh 150 you know like I'm not big so like once  do something like that it's sort of like hmm when this guy's this guy's this guy's kinky what the hell are we gonna do with him you know what I mean right and then it's just sort of like you get to decide for yourself in a way that's brilliant yeah like Robert Downey jr. is amazing as he is it's always going to be Iron Man like that sometimes you get one of those roles you know like Thor Chris Hemsworth he's fucking Thor dude your Thor forever you know you flirted with  that it depends on and I think it depends on how many of them you do when you did the Hulk were you worried about that  a little bit was there any little patient because I was surprised when you did that I got this is an interesting choice as is evident I got more worried about it you know I was I was very interested because I loved it I I'm not like snobby about I loved those Like Comics and I just grabbed him yeah I subscribe to haul guy all the darkest like Dark Knight Frank Miller in the hole  all of it was really you know it was it was  it was it was something I really latched onto and and I love the Bill Bixby Hulk yeah like he's it for me he's always for anyone in our age like he's you know him walking away at the end of the show yeah that's it and I so yeah no I thought  I tend to get  just the way I felt about American History X I actually thought American History X was sort of like a fellow or Macbeth I thought it was that's what I said to David he had written his kind of edgy thing with the drug plot in it I was like I think you strip all that away and he literally just make this about rage destroying a person who's got a lot in him it's like it's like a Shakespearean tragedy but it's just it's skinheads you know and that and that really lit David up and that's where we went with that right but Hulk Hulk is like the  it's Prometheus right the guy steals fire from the gods for people but he gets burned doing it and he's cursed right he trying to take like the power of nature back out to people from the gods and he gets burned and that's how I know that's how I thought about it I was like if we could do something like that that leans into this guy who thinks he's going for something good that's going to help humanity and he cracks oh  been like the backside of God and and take something out that is not meant to be taken out and now he's cursed like cursed you know that that's what was amazing even as silly as the show was on some levels Bill Bixby was cursed like that's what and the end of every show you were like oh my God he's cursed like alone in the world and cursed right and there's something pretty pretty heavy in that like pretty cool in that and and so so it was  was it wasn't  you know I thought it was like really worth of crack I fucking loved it how did that seem come to play where you were with Hicks and Gracie oh cuz I cuz I was I studied Aikido when I was in college I was studying Aikido and then when I was studying Aikido  hoist Gracie won the you know that was one of those Fighting Championship that was like the late 80s right 1993 93 okay close yeah so he right so but he I became aware oh no that's it that you're right you're right because I was in New York I was studying Aikido in New York and and hoist Gracie won that first UFC and like I said I'm 6 feet tall but I literally if I'm in shape I weigh like 155  it and hoist when he won that was 170 like six feet and under 180 right yep and I remember it melted everybody's mind yeah I mean it melted everybody's mind and I so I became interested in them and and what they were doing honestly do you know that you know in the story in there and that families whole crazy story about being you know they were Scottish the grandfather was Scott  - right and he was like a consular or he was a Customs he was a customs official in Brazil and because he had a good relationship with the Japanese console and helped was with very generous in helping Japanese people get their papers to come through and in the Japanese console I think the story is who's who knew Aikido and Jiu-Jitsu offered to like teach his sons yeah it was count my  right yeah who came to he came to Brazil and taught Carlos and Horry and and and hilly oh well what most of the fire really others of the voice second generation when Helios the oldest son I think I think Horry and was the oldest son he's the one who created The Ultimate Fighting Championship but Hickson the reason why I was so significant that you had him is that was the champion of the family like right undeniably Undisputed everyone everyone throughout  Jutsu this it's very very rare that one figure is universally recognized as being the superior product of Jiu-Jitsu and that was Hickson yeah you knew all way I yeah if you followed that stuff at all you kind of yes heard that breakdown of it and yeah I thought I thought a part of the story I think Hickson told me  when we were in Rio I think what he said to me was that the reason Gracie Jiu-Jitsu became its particular derivation and its particular kind of things that allowed hoist to do so well was because their father was smaller than his brother Sileo right and he and be cut and they were all bigger and because he was smaller he adapted yeah you know he adapted the style to work for a smaller person against the bigger  person yeah obviously and and then that kind of like reached its its Pinnacle with voice winning that yes that tournament which at this this gets down in the weeds for people who aren't into this stuff but the but it was I mean that was you talk about these things the cracking through moment right that was a cracking through moment it was like wait a minute a guy his size just literally one and all for Mall size tournament like how is that possible you know what I mean  and it was like it was like Jaw hits floor and to me what was really interesting was I was really little all the way until literally the end of high school I was very small I grew a lot in my like when I was like 17 but I was really interested in Japan and I was interested in martial arts and you know James clavell Shogun like not you know and and I would take I took like a karate class and it scared me I it was people if they were bigger and faster it was just scary if you were  it'll it was like I can't it doesn't matter if I can do these combos or whatever in truth I'm terrified of anybody bigger than me and I don't feel that this is teaching me anything that I would have the confidence to to use to defend myself right that's how I felt as a kid hmm and when I when I bumped into Aikido I it completely changed my mind the guy there was an incredible teacher in New Haven when I was in college and he was small  all he was like you know maybe smaller than y is Grace here whatever and the guy was unbelievably like potent like just in case one of the most potent teachers in anything I ever had I was riveted by this guy and and and it kind of started to make me believe that with grappling and locking which there's a lot of there's a lot of jujitsu and Aikido and I was sort of like I was fascinated I started feeling like  this this this makes me feel like I it's not like kicking someone's ass at all it's just more like I feel more empowered I feel I feel able to handle an authentic situations which is a mentally empowering more than like I want to get into scraps right and it was just kind of amazing it's like having a secret in a way like whoa there's a secret to a much smaller person being able to leverage a much bigger person and then that thing happened with the Gracie's and it was sort of like  like the whole thing cracked open it was like this it was like proof yes in a way you know and and if you were interested in that stuff it was an incredible moment but because my interest in that four years when we went to Rio Rio and I had been working on the script of that movie and stuff and I was like I was really interested in this idea that Banner is is desperate for control right that he desperately desperately needs to control his heart rate his breathing that it's  massive liability and his mind if he can't control his emotions and his adrenaline and I was like well who in the world and I'd seen the videos of hicks I'd never met him or any of them but I'd seen the videos of him doing the amazing stuff with his stomach yeah the yoga yeah the breathing fire and I was like and I just was like we have to end and everyone was like who's that I was like I was like I was like Philistines you're all Philistines like I was like and I was like find me Hicks and Gracie and ask him  if he'll do a scene with me in the movie being the guy who's training Banner to like calm himself and he was there and he did it with us and it was like I was like yeah there it is right here yeah yeah when I saw this in the movie I was like oh fuck yeah like what a smart move yeah and I was like I was like yeah see I got I forgot this holy crap I haven't looked at this in a long time he's like how care  attic is he zooms I mean the guy could have been like Charles Bronson a hundred percent a movie star did you ever see choke the documentary yeah one of the greatest documentaries in history and like pumpkin silently yeah absolutely for martial arts and it details hickson's Journeys to Japan to fight in Japan value to which was around 94 which is right after his brother had won the Ultimate Fighting Championship and the story was that if his brother lost Hickson was going in like the idea was  level bringing hoist because it's more impressive he's a smaller man he's not physically imposing whereas Hickson in that video there he was older when he was young he was you know very fit and it was big into yoga and physical fitness and he had the strongest body of all the Graces like he looked very formidable right whereas hoist looked unassuming and it was a more of an advertisement of Jiu-Jitsu of hoist could beat everybody and hoist wound up doing but if at any reason right if they needed to bring in the big gun that's going to be hexen and hi  always talked about it like Hicks and could tap him left and right and everybody was like that doesn't even make sense right voices the Ultimate Fighting Champion he's the guy but his brother would just run right through him you run right he would run right through everybody he would they would have a line of black belts and they would all wait for their turn to get tapped and they would roll with Hickson and he would just dismantle everybody people that thought they understood Jiu-Jitsu it's so there's so many levels and layers to Jujitsu that even though it looks like what is the difference is guys doing an armbar you're doing an arm  bar there's specifics in the intricate aspects of the positions that Hickson understood that they just didn't understand and then on top of that he had much greater control of his body because of his yoga background I mean he became obsessed with yoga and breathing yeah some breathing and something called gymnastic natural which was like style of movement that was like sort of like Vinyasa yoga with all these like a flowing postures but also with a bunch of like almost like animal movements to it too and it was a  very physically demanding thing and he became outstanding at that as well all right but it's people don't be from the outside we start talking about things like Jiu-Jitsu and Ultimate Fighting you think of like is brutal violent but it's an intellectual Pursuit and it's a spiritual Pursuit because to be the person that can overcome all the obstacles you have to have incredible control of your emotions and your thought process is and your understanding of who you are and that I think is one of the things that separated Hickson from  D I do too I also think that I think that people don't realize that  a lot of a lot of stress a lot of aggression it's like aggression actually is like paired with stress usually you know what I mean you know it's hard to be aggressive super aggressive without a little bit of like adrenaline pumping and stressing all these things in the truth is like there's so much of the training if you're actually trying to stuff what you're training yourself to do is be calm that and that's like totally counterintuitive because people think know you got to go in there  like Rocky and you know want to win and it's like well enough fighting config in a competition sure on some level but really really really great people kind of in any sport but it's even more counterintuitive and fighting is is thieves you need to cultivate calm yeah and the ability to to to be clinical and think calmly control your breathing because like you get exhausted if you can't control your breathing and and the truth is is that  those are life skills that are actually very this they cultivate a very appear calm the it helps you cultivate calm and life and the thing I always really liked about Aikido is that there aren't attacks in it it was developed by a guy more how you Sheba who was a he was an all-around budgets who Master he was like in Jiu-Jitsu Kendo karate all these things and he he  Aikido because he had joined the global pacifist movement he he was like a one of the most respected like cross form Japanese martial artists and he became he joined the same movement for passivism that Gandhi was a part of in like the 20s and he believed that martial arts could contribute to passivism if they refined and he and Aikido was a  assignment of Kendo Jiu-Jitsu Judo and and he basically said I'm going to develop a non-aggressive martial art that has all it has no attacks and there's a new K in it like for the thing but it's only a defensive and it's like that that phrase we all here redirection of energy yeah the conversion of negative energy into into neutral that's like the that's his that is really his contribution he was like you can take you can  take the most aggressive energy and you can neutralize and you can neutralize it very peacefully or you can neutralize it with a little more teeth in it depending on how aggressive the person's being but I loved that I thought that was amazing because it was like  I wasn't like looking to be in fight but I love the idea that you had conveyed that you could have control and you could like neutralize and I think I think there's something kind of amazing that I think it's like actually aligns with like yoga with with meditation with all things surfing I mean II that's what surfing is like there's all this energy coming at you like and it's going to like put you into the rocks or rock you were flip you over her and you but you you don't you don't  happen you kind of you look at it you look at a million waves you figure out how to move yourself you get in there and you get the exact opposite of getting torch to get like the best thing ever right and I think things like that that are  where you have to those are like Zen you know what I mean and I think like Jiu-Jitsu what really what you're saying is really ultimately like why he was great as he had he had like the deepest Zen yeah of anybody in the whole thing because he was the calmest and he had like the micro micro micro micro understanding of forms but really like it's something deeper it's like he it's like Neo in The Matrix he's like seeing it with more granularity yeah yeah everything yeah  the full package of it did you ever see any of Steven Seagal when he was very young hmm what he was teaching in Japan I was totally fast I mean it's like it's really weird right like me right like act like like serious actor thoughtful actor I'm like what did you know but I like above the law yeah because I was into all that stuff when above the law came out and there was the scene in above the line he's in and Aikido you know Gigi with the black thing and he's doing these things and I was  ribbed I was like oh my God like like this is so cool like when have you ever seen this in a movie yeah and I'm and he was a you know big guy and he made it violent yeah it's very unusual sort of contribution to martial arts because men martial arts movies yeah he made it realistic yeah it was one of the most realistic martial arts movies ever yeah it was and you know when you look back on it it there's things about it don't date yeah for well course but it was undeniably like Lily what you just showed that Sting the  ding of the guy coming it's that simple thing that's rust and the brake and the thing it's yes he also in the film when the guys come at him and I see this is shows you how it burns your brain there's a scene where there's in a like a bodega and the guy I think he smashes a bottle and he comes at him and he does like a move and my Kido it's called like kotegaeshi it's like he it's like the wrist you know it's like the wrist break flip over and it was just like oh my God like he's doing he's doing like  like you know nuanced Aikido moves in a big action movie it was kind of cool well he was one of the first I think the first Westerner to run a dojo in Japan I mean he was a legitimate Aikido Master yeah and I think but what's interesting is when I studied over there he was his country it was slightly controversial because I don't think he was he had broken away from like like you Sheba Aikido he was doing  he was doing like the way that Gracie Jiu-Jitsu is not pure Japanese Jiu-Jitsu he was doing something with the it was somehow it was Associated more with Osaka than Tokyo where the hombu dojo and Aikido is and there was some contact yeah there was there was just you know like the way things are with schools of thought hmm but um but yeah he had a certain legit kind of thing and it's really wild because people like Mike Ovitz who was like the power agent of all of Hollywood in the 80s you know  got a black belt training with Seagal like he was really serious Aikido is just I didn't know that yeah that makes sense yeah it does he's a cautionary tale to that I mean not even Elvis I mean Seagal you know yeah what I've become I guess I honestly my my I don't know anything about him past a certain point like I don't know what went on  in there yeah but leave it at that yeah II don't tell me about your new movie let's leave it that it's called motherless Brooklyn  it's it was a you know it was kind of a big swing because I wrote it and I produced it and this is the first time you've done that directed it I know I produced and directed The the first movie I directed his Keeping the Faith with its it's me and Ben Stiller play a rabbi and a priest who are best friends and they and they both fall for the same girl do you ever see that one no I didn't it's funny yeah you'd like it  is hilarious in it that was obviously lighter that was a lighter kind of movie but it was and I'm I've lived in New York they're almost 30 years and I like making movies in New York a lot that was a pretty light one this one is more  this takes place in the 50s in New York and it's kind of it's got a Chinatown at like confidential kind of a Noir bent to it it's a it's a mystery and murder mystery of kind of that leads into some of the stuff that happened in New York in the 50s that is hard to believe because New York was  New York was run by an it was run by basically a Darth vader-like figure who's never elected to public office and Pete excuse me people thought he was the parks Commissioner of New York but he was for from 1932 1968 he had uncontested authoritarian power over New York City and New York State and he made every significant decision about the way that the modern infrastructure of New York was built where the roads went where the bridges  build what was torn down where the projects were built he and he was very racist and he baked like really discriminatory things that almost sound like conspiracy theory there so wild and intense into the decisions he made he was responsible for the Dodgers leaving Brooklyn and going to La and nobody knows this like that you think of me New York is the great that's like the great egalitarians Melting Pot City where democracy works except that it was run by a  total autocrat for 38 years yeah for for he's largely it's broadly accepted that no mayor or governor of New York do a single thing without his say-so from basically about 1930 to about 1968 how is that even possible and how come no one knows about this how did you find Dad it well people do there's there's there's Hue like in 1 of the big Burns Brothers documentaries about New York there's a hole literally almost a whole episode on him there's a great book  about him that won the Pulitzer Prize and there's his name was Robert Moses and he you know there's Robert Moses State Beach in New York and but literally people think he was the parks commissioner but he was and he was like Anakin Skywalker I he was like a Jedi Knight he was a big liberal Progressive believer in Progressive change and government reform and in his early years he got crushed by Tammany Hall and and the power Brokers and he went he  went dark went complete yeah that's not the most imposing picture of him that you got up there's other ones that that's an invite is one of the ones of him find one of the ones of him standing in front of his models there's famous ones of him that looks like a man yeah actually the to the left of that and keep going to the left of that because there's a scene in our movie where Alec Baldwin is literally like that yeah that Alec Baldwin ascended plays a character who's based on and him inspired by him I should say it's not at all in my film it's not the true story  but yeah there you go and but I think this idea I was really interested in this idea  you know what's great about Chinatown as a film is  it's mostly sexy the you don't know what the hell is going on in that movie like until the until 20 minutes before the end you have absolutely no idea really what's going on in that movie but it's just sexy it's like the music is amazing the photographies incredible the actors are like adult and real and he's he's Nicholson right wheel the hook is like Nicholson is so cool you really will kind of follow him you'll watch the way he deals with anything and just  you're just laughing and enjoying it right but Underneath It All when you're done you go  did that is that true did LA is La basically built on Stolen water is that like the like LA's original sin is that people made fortunes the valley was just farms and they stole the water from up North and you know rig the game and made these gigantic fortunes by irrigating San Fernando Valley and you you come away with Like You Come Away with an awareness that like the California stories not exactly what it is  act up to be right it's there's some big crimes underneath it and and the people who and and that in that movie it's like yeah that people ripped everybody off they fake droughts they created fortunes does and the type of people who did that also rape their daughters literally that's like what that movie is about it's and it and it's pretty bleak it's like you can't make a difference you cannot change anything like any of you try the person you're trying to help is going to end up  with a bullet through her I dead on the steering wheel like it's a really dark movie and people forget that because you just go Nichols invade on away it's like nah that's a that's a really really Bleak movie but I love I love the idea that  that you can do things where like the the pleasure of it is like the pleasure of movies it's grown-up is kind of what we've been talking about it's like like if you said to most people if you showed Chinatown the most critics today they'd go long boring whatever it's like you want to say fuck off like fuck off like what what is it that you who are you why are you assuming people can't handle grown up you know what I mean and and  I think that that I really dig those things where you go through the movie starts you look at it and you go this looks really good this looks really grown up this is big the actors are like like adult and authoritative the dialogues great the music is great it's hypnotic and your brain just goes I don't know what's going on I don't care I'm bought in and then and if there's a character in it that you can hook into you float you float through those movies you just kind of go  where's this going what's going on I don't know man that guy who she's great he's great wow like this is just all juicy and great and by the end you get somewhere and you got to go I'll be damned that actually was about big things did those things really happen you know that's I really dig those movies I did Chinatown LA Confidential I think the Godfather works that way the Godfather's about immigrants you know it's about immigrants normalizing in America  you don't it's like that's a long movie yeah you just settle in for that moment your brain settles in and just goes this just couldn't be better I couldn't be happier to be watching this scene after scene after scene like and I wanted to make I'd wanted to try I wanted to try to make one of those you know myself like I wanted to try to to make one of those because I don't it's cliche to say like they don't make those anymore  but it but I think you know they were always hard it's not like they were easy once and now they're hard they're all they're always hard but I  I would look at people like Warren Beatty he made Reds you know which is one of the great movies from that era even like Spike Lee doing do the right thing I don't know if you remember when that movie hit sure it was massive it was a huge deal to me I was like 18 or 19 yeah I saw that movie and I was like he just rewrote the game like this kid who the hell is that he wrote it he directed it he acted in it he got Public Enemy to the music yeah it's about his neighborhood in New York but it's about like race  America it's like oh my God that guy just took like a huge swing in Connected on like every level and it didn't even give you some BS kind of like don't worry it's going to be okay in the end right it was like  Martin Luther King says violence is not the way Malcolm X says sometimes it's the only rational response what do you think you know what I mean it was so ballsy it was so ballsy that movie and I think like  after a while it's sort of like I just sort of feeling like well you know I don't really need to gig I might as well I've worked with a lot of great people I've worked with some pretty great directors including Spike and I was kind of like that in New York a long time and I just thought it was really weird no one knew that story and I was like I'm going to try to make one about this you know as someone who doesn't make movies I always wonder like what happened between like say Steve McQueen's LeMans you did you ever see that McCord  you remember how there's no dialogue at all for like the longest time and I remember I watched it recently within the last couple years and one of the thoughts was I don't even know if they could do this today if anybody would allow them to make a movie where no one talks for a long time they're just sort of setting the stage of what it means to be a race car driver what's the atmosphere of the races  it's just the the idea that you were saying earlier about having this short attention span theater this this these movies that are designed for what they believe is a populace of people that don't have the interest in something that's more unique or something that requires thought something that drags you in and that was much more common in the past like why was it more common in in that era of McQueen and all those other movies that  I did like that and what has happened and what like these rare examples like when I got does break through with something like do the right thing or a few other examples why doesn't that stimulate the appetite for more well is it that hard to do on one level on one level yeah it's it's it's easy to recognize when they're great but it's still not eat it's still not easy to make them great  it's still we're talking about people who  our some of our greatest artists are directors you know what I mean they and lots of people they try on some level they try on some level but they just not everybody is Spike Lee right you know what I mean not everybody is Francis Coppola or you know it's like it it people people sometimes people make things and they actually are slow you know what I mean like you know what I mean you're like it's  it's yeah it's like it's like in spinal tap when they're like it's a fine line between stupid and clout you know know it's a fine line between clever and stupid you know what I mean it's like it's I think people try but I think I think that there are some people who really do think Jaws  had a big effect on movies because it was it was like the first true Blockbuster right and  I don't know you know what actually though I'm I'm wrong I think that what happens more often than not is  adult people get the jobs at the big companies that make the decisions about what to make right and at a certain point they sort of age out they start to age out and they don't actually have any idea what what the vibe is they don't know what to make for the coming wave of younger people and so these little windows open up now and then we're in that era they needed there  they needed new people they needed like you know George Lucas making American Graffiti nobody thought that movies could be a hit nobody you know they they open up they say we don't know what to do do something different and a couple of new voices like come in and they make things that are really different you know but the idea that that was only then like there's a whole book right now about 1999 you know there's this  book that came out about how 1999 was one of those years where because the Studio's had kind of lost their sense of exactly what to do and Miramax was making a shit ton of money on on autor driven movies made for low cost and the Studio's all went and set up little mini miramax's right and the result was that  like in that year you had like Meg you know Paul Thomas Anderson Wes Anderson Alexander Payne Spike Jones David o'russell Fincher the wachowskis like and unbelievable array of directors made really really memorable films in that year and I think it was because  it was like another one of those moments like we don't know what to we don't know what to do we're just going to have to like close our eyes and go you kids you kids figure it out you know what I mean that's the thing about films it seems to me it's such a collaborative effort and when you have so many moving pieces and so many people involved that have a say in the decision making process it's got to be insanely difficult to get something out that's pure yes that's true that's true Francis Coppola  said that the best thing about making films is that their collaborative and the worst thing about making films is that their collaborative you also said it's the last it's the last moral totalitarian job in the world like being a director or something I can't remember but it's true you you it's a very because like I made this movie I had like  I had a fraction of like the budget of the Irishman right I'm just which I'm naming only because it was a period piece you know mines in the 50s that one's crazy things and and I had like like less days to do it than I had on my first movie that I directed his job do it like 46 which for perspective Fight Club was a hundred and thirty day shoot and and 46 days  is less than most movies I've made and this was a big 1950s like period film with a huge like French Connection style chart car chase in the opening running through Harlem across the bridge down into Queens you know we weren't like making a little kitchen sink drama and to figure that out that is like you can be like I got the vision we're going to do this but there's a kind of Madness in saying this is what I want to do I want to recreate  at the old Penn Station that doesn't exist anymore right which we have in the film like my character goes into the old Penn Station that was torn down in 1963 or whatever and and you only pull that off with the most Kick-Ass Justice League of collaborators imaginable like they make you look like you're a Visionary or know what you're doing because you get these people with crazy talents of their own and I don't mean just cast  although I had that too in this I mean like some of the very very very best people bring their their talent to like making that work and and so that's like when you say like your job is Liz more to say I have really talented people I've got to get their frequency wave in line with mine if I can get their frequency wave in line with mind then it can be my my idea my vision my weird ideas can be in there but it's with its  cuted with the help of people who believe in it and buy into it you know that's that's the key is like your your your marshaling people to get to it in sync with you and and you know I have a sick cat it's like Bruce Willis Alec Baldwin Willem Dafoe Bobby Cannavale a Michael K Williams who was like Omar on The Wire wow this great actress goo  and Arthur raw and and Leslie Mann and you know on and on and on and I got and all these people did this as a favor to me because I didn't have any money to do it wow so first starting with Bruce Bruce was like you know he said to me a long time ago I'll if you have something good I want to be in it I really want to do the kind of stuff you're doing and I really mean it I'll do anything you want to do and help you get it done I was like he's not going to remember that you know he's gonna be like sure sure but I'm doing die hard like for the rest of the year and he didn't he was  like where do you need me I told you I'm in Wow Let's get it done and basically Bruce Alec will and people like that I practically call them co-finance here's on my film because they I only got it done because they deferred everything you know and I think that's really cool that's amazing yeah when you write something like this car chase scene through Harlem mean I would imagine the logistics of pulling something like that off it's got to be insane yeah it's nuts how does when you wrote it and you brought it to the people that are  the stunt people the people that coordinate these Chase scenes with a like oh fuck people get people yes you know doing the things is not hard getting permission to do them in Manhattan is is tricky and there are people who look at you like you're dreaming man like you're not and and you what you do is you go out and Scout and you start  art you say look this is the we can do this here and this here and this isn't Hardison are we only need this one block cleared as things then you like find that place where you're like I want him to do a huge screeching turn on the Frederick Douglass Boulevard because it has a nine-block stretch where there's very few buildings that don't look like they're in the 50s right leading up to a bridge that you want to go over the bridge and then you get with like the guys at the NYPD and you beg like you just beg you go look  we're going to be like The Dirty Dozen we're going to have the we're going everything is going to be so well planned and ready to go will be able to will say just shut it down and then 20 minutes will be done you know what I mean like you you start any minute well no just for a shot you know it's like we just need to do this once or twice to get this this turn of the car around the corner and headed up the Avenue with 80 cars from the 50s and you know using legitimate 1950s cars as well yeah so those things handle like  they're horrible their boats with wheels on so any car that's actually got to be doing anything like going fast or making a big turn you have to have four of the same model that you've painted identically because they're going to break like they will break you'll push one hard it will break and then you have to like bring the other one in wow you know what I mean so you you  and you basically can't make them go fast you know they don't have pick up right so you're figuring out like what are the moves we can make that make it feel like this thing is really bombing and and and how do we cross cut around the fact that he takes three blocks for it to accelerate I mean like literally to go from you know 10 miles an hour to 40 you need like literally like three or four blocks so you have to like get it up to speed for the section that you want it going fast and it's  it's I'm not doing another period movie I'm doing about the next movie I'm doing is going to have Tesla p100 these that go like zero to 60 in two point four now when you coordinate when you write this out like how much time is involved in preparation of writing this and then doing all the scouting and then trying to implement this whole it took me a couple years to write it because I haven't even said in I think you have to know yourself I'm not Bogart  I'm not like Jack Nicholson the magic they bring is the magic they bring in the character I put it the middle of this is the detect the detective that I play has Tourette syndrome and obsessive-compulsive Disorder so he he can't like when he hit you know when he meets a blond at the bar he's like the opposite of Bogart he he tries to light her match and can't stop blowing it out because it doesn't sound right to him so it's he's kind of a train wreck like  he's the opposite of of a cool detective and in fact Bruce Willis plays the cool detective who he works for so like Bruce Willis is Nicholson but when something bad happens to him and my guy has to like step out of the assistant role you know he's like his operative because he has a great memory he has like a photographic memory and some really weird ability to like because his brain is is chaotic and crazy  Z he has certain little gifts that Bruce Willis like relies on him for and believes in him but when but when he has to sort of figure out what happened to his boss and solve this mystery like he kind of has to come out on his own out of his comfort zone and kind of become a detective and and it and it's like you know he's ticking and twitching and shouting and doing things that make it very difficult for him to move in the world so that's kind of like  I had that part of it and I was grafting it into this story of of what happened in New York in the 50s and it took me a long time to write it and get it right but once I had it right you know we probably prep the movie for like nine months we we were we were actively like scouting New York  you know and and imagining like where can we do this and how can we do this but I live in New York so I loved it I like get on my motorcycle and go up to Harlem and Washington Heights and and literally like cruise around just cruise around I know the area really well anyway but sometimes you just have to like just and that's where a bike in New York is really great like because you can just sort of float around float around float around mentally mapping like where you can do  thing and and it was it was pretty fun actually such a bold move riding a bike in New York City no it's not it's not always La is way way way more dangerous because New York no one's going that fast right you can be I can't explain it in New York there's a rationality to the way people are moving but I'll tell you the number one main thing New York requires New York driving  it's so stop and start and it's a things nobody has time to be on their phone and in La if I'm on a bike I would say I regularly look to my right and I look to my left and both people on either side of me or texting do you have hurt I mean yes all the time all the time when I'm on my truck especially because I can look down yeah and you realize you realize that in this town 60% of people at any given moment are texting on their  fun and it's just appalling and it's so dangerous yeah and I'll be on if I'm on a motorcycle and Lala I'll look at people they're texting for so long and finally I'll have to like hit the horn or something and look at them I've gotten past like you know anger and literally just looked at people flip my thing up and gone like please like please get off your phone like you're going to kill somebody and kill yourself but but we can't  we can't break the addiction people cannot break the addiction and I it's not a more you realize it is in the character flaw it's not it's not like what an asshole it's everybody it's your mom it's your sister it's your friend everybody is doing it because we're addicted like a device addicted but but when you're on a bike and you realize like I am floating in a sea of people who are going to  to mess up someone is going to mess up and they've got airbags and you know new modern stuff and you're on this but like you know of anything yeah I don't I think I think I think this is way more dangerous riding than the New York that makes sense when you talk about things like the 405 or the one-on-one when people are flying by and passing and changing lanes in the the texting to yeah and also the big Avenues people get up you know Wilshire Boulevard whatever they're looking at thing and they blow that  red light right over time and half the times you hear about or see bad accidents here especially if they involve motorcycles I mean it's like it's not like the person screwed the person on the bike didn't screw up someone went through a red light right and just broadsided them or they T-Bone the thing you know it's just it's like do you really want to make the bet the huge bet on yourself where what you're riding on is other people's concentration  no it's were you riding when you were living out here I've never I've always lived in New York so when you've been here it's only from few months at a time I know where I've I have I've been Winters out here I like to Surf and  I'm and I'm by the way I'm like not I'm not like a pro experienced like veteran motorcycle rider at all I just did enjoy it and like out here it's fun you know like go up the Angeles Crest Road or something yeah like that you know it's love driving up there yeah it's really it's really it's cool there's California la la la is heart no one likes being on a motorcycle in La sucks it's like just hot and everybody's your face but but the you know  he's incredible there's there's there's so much there's so many amazing places to go and California and  and I kind of got hooked on it out here and so then when you were in New York you just said fuck it this is actually a good place to ride a bike no I thought it's not even that I ride bicycles to in New York I like it but it's more just that the thing that pulls you in I mean I have lots I you know I like to Surf I fly planes I like there's a lot of stuff that I think is much much much it's thrilling it's much safer than riding motorcycles it's not like my jam mmm but once you have that skill set once you  and do it if you have a bike there are those times in Allah and in New York to where you take a look at like the gridlock and you just like I'm going to be if I'm going to be in this for a forever and on a bike you can Lane split and just get you know you can get where you need to go and in New York to you can you can zip around in ways that is efficient so how long did this how long did you sit on this story  how long did you know about this and how what was the process of having this sort of build in your mind the point where you wanted a ride it direct and produce It cast it honestly I read the book exactly 20 years ago I read it in the fall of 1990 when I was  when Fight Club came out that's right around the time as I read this novel motherless Brooklyn but but the novels about the terrific detective who's trying to solve the murder of his his only friend basically but it takes place in the 90s it's not about any of that stuff about New York in the 50s or anything it's just and the character is just amazing though like amazing so  read it the hook was the character I was like I was like what a great character it's so it's such a wild he's like I just as hot mess of of he's smart but he's totally messed up he's he's funny but also really pretty painful and lonely and it was just everything and I was like that's I could get so into trying to figure that out  for reasons that are a little hard to explain the tone of the book feels like a 50s detective novel but it's set in the modern world and I was afraid in a movie that would feel a little bit like The Blues Brothers like guys in fedoras but a Prius is Bryant a sort of like hmm maybe this would just be cooler if we set it in the 50s and I talked to the author about that and he was super into those movies and so he said okay wow so then then but then the middle period  the period of mashing that up with the with these sort of Stories the New York Chinatown kind of of it the the deep dark history of what really went on in New York and that took a long time and then I had it ready in 2012 I was really ready to go and I just couldn't get it to guy couldn't get Bruce was that he was in and that was kind of angry but I couldn't get everyone I wanted together at the same time and I couldn't get them the amount of money I needed or that I thought I  I wanted and I couldn't get a studio to back it  because honestly you know number one like I'm not like you know I'm not like a green light anything he does kind of an actor that's it's just you know I think that's a that's a different sort of thing but also I was out there saying it's sort of like Rain Man meets LA Confidential and people's eyes just kind of cross they're like they're like  bring us the next one like they're like we don't get it we don't get it we don't get yet it's like and also I got like I had like this idea of getting I love Radiohead and I like jazz and I wanted to like I got Thom Yorke to write a song for the film but I got Wynton Marsalis to do all the Jazz and stuff and people were also they were like this is these things are not going to go well together you know and then they went to get like a lot of people have said to me which is  not if not meeting a lot of people said to me is the best music in a film that they've heard in many many years flee flee played trumpet and base on Thom yorke's track in the film and and Fleet you know fleas like a really good trumpet player and his dad was a jazz musician and I didn't know that Fleet came out of the movie like crying he was like that's honestly my favorite music that I've ever heard in a film and I think and and but you can't you can't tell people that  you I thought that would work I thought this matchup would work because I knew Tom and I knew he loves Charles Mingus and and I knew Winton was capable of doing he's really interested in dissonant weird edgier kind of modernist music as well and I was like this is going to work and it and it did it's really the music is amazing in the film it's like its own  like the wreck the records out now and people are flipping out about the just the music and the movie hasn't even come out yet it's such a crazy combination of factors and details that you smashed all together yeah and it's got a feel first of all it's got to be a tremendous relief and also feel amazing that it's you did it I do feel that I feel like it would have haunted me and I it was rattling around in my head such a long time I felt very discouraged about it  at times that's kind of like you know I've done a few okay things like I've done some stuff that was weird and that people didn't understand and it's it's come together pretty great you know what I mean and and you sort of go oh God I never I never expect anybody to give me money to make something like that's that's just risky like I would never put money into making movies never like it's too risky you know and I get it so I'm not like I  nervous like what but it was more like  I sometimes I was just like am I going to be able to figure this out or not am I going to get this done and and I think getting it done and having it not having quit on it and in some ways feeling not actually knowing that it's better that I made it now I know more I was more if I tried to do it 20 years ago I couldn't I didn't have the chops to do  some of the things like working with Spike Lee and Alejandro and you really when people like that really like it upped my sense of how to do I learned a lot about how to do a big thing with out all the money in the world now this is released Nationwide worldwide like when it's released on this Friday right yeah this Friday it's everywhere after tomorrow brought all over America yet yeah it's a wide release Here I hope yeah and I think honestly like  the day it comes out like you can either see Terminator like not 9.11 or or ours there's like not and I like certify on The Joe

Rogan Experience Train by day Joe Rogan podcast by now  boom there we go hello hey man what's going on going on buddy good to see you again good to see you and your wonderful pink shirt yeah I'd say it's confident right pink and gray it's like you're confident you got a lot of shit going on yeah the lowdown on this though is I was supposed to get this dry cleaned when I was in Tennessee for political on which was just a few days ago and then even when I got here I was like I gotta get this dry clean going on Rogan show of course I didn't but it doesn't look too wrinkly it looks good thanks man looks very good appreciate it so tell me what you were saying right when I walked  and I said hold this thought you were you're saying that Chelsea Manning is locked up and they're charging her $1,000 a day yeah Chelsea Manning is locked up right now because they wanted her to say more stuff against Julian Assange she's refusing to do it and they're finding her I think it's over a thousand dollars a day so that shows you you know because before that we were talking about Snowden yeah and that shows you that they do not mess around when they feel like you're uncovering their BS yeah now what are they trying to get from Julian Assange like what are they  have on him well Julian Assange there's a there's a couple reasons why they despise him but he has no political home right now particularly because it used to be Democrats that defended him right but then he pissed off the Democrats because he leaked on the DNC and he showed you know what was going on with Hillary behind the scenes and how the primary is basically rigged against Bernie Sanders so Democrats used to like him now Democrats hate them and Trump used to like them when he said when he was getting this information on Hillary but they hate him as well because Trump has basically  we been convinced by the people around him in the White House that this guy is dangerous because this guy basically expose you as war crimes that's why they're coming after him because he released a video which showed that we were killing civilians and then we Circle back around and did what's called a double tap where we killed the First Responders and the idea of the time was oh it's okay we're going after al-qaida but come to find out that wasn't Al-Qaeda they were innocent civilians then they were the medics that came afterwards and so Julian Assange thought Hey listen this is not something we should be doing  wing and the American people deserve to know about this this shouldn't be top-secret this is a war crime and so he released that and then that's why they are coming after him and throwing the book at him because you know just like with Mike reveal previously Daniel Ellsberg actually so I'm thinking of just like with Daniel Ellsberg when he showed the what we were doing in Vietnam and how we were killing civilians they do not want you to expose their war crimes they will throw the book at you and act like you're a spy you're working for a foreign country you're a traitor because they want to keep that stuff under wraps because it really embarrasses them and it really shows  so what u.s. Empire is doing around the world that was the collateral murder video yes yeah what's really bizarre about this is how no one speaks out against it no one no one on the right note on the left it's just this thing now yeah I don't I mean it's like it doesn't have a home yeah well unfortunately what you see is it becomes very partisan so when when Obama is doing drone strikes and killing 90% innocent people unfortunately partisan Democrats don't talk about it now that Trump has increased drone strikes by 4  hundred thirty two percent over Obama with still a tremendously High civilian death rate now you know maybe some Democrats will talk about it but Republicans certainly don't talk about it but 432 purse or hundred thirty two percent that's right and Obama was a radical acceleration of the Bush administration's drone policy that's right and Trump has increased it even more and see that's the problem is people get mad now that you know Trump is at the helm of this stuff but all of these things now it's precedent he's not doing anything that wasn't established beforehand it was true  bastards the one you say Trump is doing it who is that exactly making the call do they bring this call to Trump and they say Hey you know we're going to bomb Yemen we're going to do this with drones and this does he have to sign off on each individual attack that's a great question and the short answer is I don't know I wouldn't be surprised if Trump was directly involved in some of these instances I know that his first military rate is president that he approved ended up killing a nine-year-old American Girl it was Anwar al-awlaki's daughter I believe and  I also do think that there is this what you can call the Deep State I know people think that's like a conspiratorial term but it's really not all that saying is that the CIA the NSA the FBI these are people who are in these positions of power and their their their throughout all these different ministrations yes Newton talked about that exactly so that's not conspiratorial and so when when you have a kill list and when you have people at the CIA and the Pentagon by the way a lot of them are calling the shots and maybe they just need an okay every now and then from President Trump  umph but yeah I mean I think that there's it's not just one person making all the decisions I think that the president does play a role but I also think it's generals I think it's people at the CIA and I think it's this complex web of people who are all kind of involved in this thing that ends up being drastically negative yeah drastically negative to put it mildly right when you talking about 90% civilian casualties with drone strikes that's such a disturbing thing that this continues that no one says hey this is grossly  effective and horriffic and its consequences yeah what they do is you know they give everybody a false choice they make it seem like Hey listen man if we're not doing these all out ground invasions and we're not doing like war war with boots on the ground well what do you want us to do like they're bad people out there we got to go after these bad people so this is like the soft power option if you will a my response that has always been yeah but you do have to follow the Constitution and the way our system is supposed to work is you can't have the president just declare war  war and just go and do it Congress has to approve or so if you wanted to do a drone War okay but you got to get a declaration of war tell me exactly which countries are going to be doing the bombing in while you're doing the bombing in those countries and get an approval through Congress so if you were to come to me and say hey man there's an Al-Qaeda cell that's very active in Pakistan Pakistan or whatever so we want to approve a drone War have Congress vote on it see what happens and then move from there but what we're doing now is it's just baked into the cake that we violate US law we violate the constitution and we  international law with all these bombings because as of right now we're bombing at least eight different countries and we also have a shadow war going on in Africa so we do absolutely Shadow War now for so The Intercept reported on this I don't know as much on this off the top of my head but Jamie if you wouldn't mind please pulling up an article from The Intercept there's a shadow war going on in Africa where we're building military bases all over Africa and the idea is I think that we have these bases where we can the drones fly out of and they could go to the Middle East  and they can bomb there this is also in response to the fact that China is essentially moving into large parts of Africa to extract minerals and seat natural resource yes and this is actually super interesting because the China thing they're doing this built-in Road initiative and basically this is like their version of Empire through debt okay so what they do is they'll go into like they just made a deal with Iraq we spend trillions of dollars in Iraq did an illegal and offensive War China swoops in and they go Hey listen what we want to do is help you  nice we want to build your infrastructure up we want to make your country beautiful so if you do a deal with us we're going to like build all the infrastructure with you credit exactly and then what happens they turn around and they say okay well then you can get a certain percentage of our oil sales or whatever it might be so this is and it's funny because there's been this like Evolution when it comes to Empires so used to be back in the day you just kind of go up on somebody Shores and say mine I'm taking it and you do it by force then the u.s. evolved from them with the u.s. does is it's this cute  it'll trick where we say oh no we're not going to control you directly what we will do is take somebody from your native land prop them up as a dictator and then they will allow us corporate interest to go in there and kind of exploit the natural resources but it's intelligent because you're saying no no we're not in there ourselves like the British did in India for example where they just showed up in there like it's ours you know there was a British presence there very clearly we have people from their native lands take control but we exploit stuff from them and extract stuff from them so China took that one step further where it's like okay  we're actually going to provide you with you know material well-being we're going to give you a solid infrastructure and then it's like you look at it more like a business deal than an expansion of Empire and honestly this is one of the weird benefits of having an authoritarian like system like China does is they can make a decision on a dime yeah you could just have the Communist party just goes yeah we will do this because this is the best way to do it and there can be no nobody can fire back and say I don't agree with that let's stop it here the way Western democracies work it's almost like you have this certain slowness this  built into the process because there's so many checks and balances and in many ways that's a good thing you want a system like that but in many ways it provides a strategic disadvantage at least when you're talking about imperialism so here's the article from The Intercept US Special Operations number surge in Africa Shadow Wars the most dramatic growth in deployment of American Elite troops of any region of the globe over the past decade according to newly released numbers Africa it says in 2006 just 1% of Commandos sent overseas with deployed  in the u.s. Africa command area of operations in 2016-17 point to 6% of all Special Operations Forces Navy Seals and Green Berets among them deployed abroad were sent to Africa so this is something that like you never hear of never hear about it never been a vote on it they just do it wow it's scary it's scary the way that it works how you really do have a deep state if you will kind of making decisions and the president just kind of goes along with it  and we're all sitting around here acting like hey man maybe instead of doing that we could actually I don't know you some of our tax dollars to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure which gets a grade of D plus I mean what are they doing it because they see a threat like exclusive u.s. as Mu has more military operations in Africa than the Middle East whoa now what is this is it possible because they see a threat I think that's the rationalization that they use but I think it has more to do with power and control and when  world's sole superpower you don't want to cede that ground anybody else right and so the benefits that come along with that and their mind is they can rationalize jacking natural resources from all over the world by saying no listen you'd rather have us in this position then you would Russia then you would China so it's really like this the idea is in their own minds it's like we're a benevolent superpower that's only doing this to keep the world order Mike Baker tried to explain why the weight to me and one of the things that he might Baker from the CIA one of the things that he was explaining  he said you have to realize that there is no such thing as industry independent of government in China if you have something like Huawei if you have a giant Corporation they are inexorably connected to the Chinese government and the moves they make are not necessarily designed for you know the infinite growth Paradigm this idea that we have in the United States with corporations are beholding the stockholders who just trying to make money that's not what they're doing over there they have a long game and the  on game involves information involves Espionage involves stealing Trade Secrets and and patents from other companies and so when they're selling them these modems they've got built-in third party options so the third party meaning China can extract information so if you're if someone has this modem and the using this modem to send information to someone in Beirut China can also get that information yeah  they do a lot of cyber I mean that that kind of thing that's been known for a long time that they're still You Know Jack patents and intellectual property and they have this whole you know economy that's kind of thriving off technology that's made elsewhere that's certainly an issue but also I would argue that is probably the case with the u.s. to that this kind of distinction between corporations in the state is largely a veneer because you have such control of our political process because of big money from corporations flowing into the system so I think that a lot of these decisions  Jenna's that are made even when it comes to foreign policy are directly in relation to how it will impact those corporations like the thing that I remember was a lightbulb moment for me back in the day when I first learned about it was the banana Wars have you ever heard about this know back in the day I think it was in the late 1800s but don't quote me on that we just went into South America and start a toppling governments because we wanted to jack their bananas and it was literally further I think the Chiquita banana company that we did that really yeah so when you look at that you go  okay well that kind of distinction between Corporation and government is not even really a thing here it's like this veneer that's in between the two but really it's the powerful moneyed interest in the elites that kind of run everything and they're married at the hip whether they're in the government or whether their incorporation what year was this I think this was the late 1890s again I'm more than happy to be fact-checked on this but I remember the first time I read about this had to be in college the banana Wars I was like that's insane for bananas  it's crazy well how about when you go throughout history and find out that a lot of the wars were over salt I didn't even know that I didn't know they killed people for salt was very important back in the day because they didn't have refrigerators so in order to preserve things and keep them from being infected by bacteria they would pour salt all over their meat and salt all of their fish and that's how they preserve things right you get apparently preserve things for long periods of times when you completely cover them with salt yeah so  yes I guess it's just always been a thing that it's like Wars over resources yes now there's a lot about oil but like we're accustomed to the oil stuff yeah we did we had you're right we have been used to having quite a while and it's interesting because what just happened with Syria and Trump that was fascinating is he at first he said oh we're getting out of here you're getting out of Northern Syria everybody went crazy and said oh my God what about the Kurds and then we come to find out like three or four days later that he's like well no we're actually taking these troops from northern Syria moving them over into Western Iraq  back and they're going to be doing the same thing that they've been doing from Western Iraq and then Trump had the nerve to go out there and say and we've secured the oil it's so tremendous we've secured the oil we're not going to make the same mistake like we made in Iraq again and this is something that he had been saying at CPAC the conservative political action conference going back for years every year he'd give a speech and he actually said like we should we should have taken the oil we should have taken the oil in Iraq because we didn't want Isis to have it and we should have it instead of Isis and it's like he's he actually rips the mask off of everything we're doing  because he has no filter it's like yeah that was a big part of it but what he's just admitting in front of the world is international law means nothing we don't care about you know the proper process we don't care about like imagine for a second China did that to us they're like no big deal or anything but we're just gonna go into Texas and we're just going to jack all your oil but don't worry because it's okay we're allowed to do that because we say we're allowed to do that we like what are you talking about but we're going to do that to a sovereign country Syria as we pretend like we care so deeply about civilian or that Syrian civilians and that's why we're there to protect them like  no we're there check their oil that's what we're trying to do and control the region so disturbing when it's that transparent exactly but that see that's it's interesting to be a better well that's what I was just about to say next is that some people make the argument that well at least there's no tap dancing bullshit whereas with all the other presidents they have this this like fake holier-than-thou attitude where they really can like put a happy face on a disgusting thing like Empire where Trump is and I think it's fair to say he's like too stupid to really go through  tap dance and so people are like hey there it is it's like it's right in front of our face but what's interesting about him is he says both things at the same time like he has the political instincts enough to know that people think war is generally bad so he always goes out there and he talks about how he thinks war is generally bad and we got to get our troops out of the Middle East I don't know why were there so stupid of doing the first place but when you look at what he's actually doing it doesn't match his rhetoric so I don't know if you remember this but like a year or so ago he tweeted we're getting out of Afghanistan  Stan finally after all these years we've been there for 18 years it was terrible we should have never been there in the first place and then we just didn't get out he said that acted like we were going to do it and then the generals behind the scenes were like ha ha that's a good one and we never got out and then he just stopped talking about it we're still there but he said he just says it he's like oh we're gonna get out of Iraq then he doesn't do it so what happens is he gets it's actually politically its it comes across sometimes as a positive because nobody follows up with it and the media doesn't do their job and say wait we didn't actually get out of there but  so comes across as a positive politically because he still doing the head fakes towards non-intervention with people agree with but it's business as usual behind the scenes how much time do you think he actually spends on any of these things and if he does spend time how does he have the time to do these interviews how does he have the time to tweet how does he have the time to watch Fox News I mean I really want to know like how much interaction he actually has with his cabinet like how much interaction does he actually have with the generals  how much interaction that's that's the Dirty Little Secret Joe is that it can't be much it's not because what he really does is he watches Fox News all day and tweets out their videos and he tweets all day well how ya right how can you be doing that and then also doing what we think you should do look I don't have any time and all I do is do podcasts right so I watch him and I'm like this isn't make any fucking sense no so here's the thing and there was a story that was reported before he became president I think it was after he got the Republican nomination there was an interesting story that  it wasn't discussed too much but I thought it was fascinating because the Trump team apparently approach John Kasich who just like kind of a standard establishment Republican and he was the governor of maybe in Ohio but I'm not sure if one of those States over there but anyway was allow so he approached John Kasich and basically said to him boss behind the scenes Hey listen man if I end up winning this election I want you to kind of like be my vice president run the day-to-day at the White House take care of dot all the I's cross all the t's do all the work like that and I want to go around the country and keep doing Ray  Ali's and rile up everybody and get everybody to our side so basically and this shouldn't come as a surprise to anybody what's that what if you win why do you have to rile everybody up we'll see he's the first president to never stop campaigning he's always campaigning he's always doing rallies and there's a reason why he's doing that Joe it's the only thing he loves on this Earth it's that and watching Fox News that he loves so that's what he does with all of his time and everything else yes he's just see this is the thing Joe he took all these deeply establishment figures Steve man  in of Goldman Sachs Stephen forgetting his name cone something cocoa in cone another guy from Goldman Sachs he had all these just career insiders brought them into his administration whether it's with the economy with foreign policy John Bolton deep neoconservative he said he believed in the opposite philosophy but then but then you put John Bolton the power because he wants the system to keep running as it is and runs smoothly while he goes around and just you know makes the name for himself and talks about how amazing and tremendous this country is and what an amazing  amazing job we're doing so it's funny because he has two different personas one of them is I'm going to pretend to be the anti-establishment guy and rally people up Non-Stop and be a politician and be good at it and then the other thing is behind the scenes he's like guys just keep everything running and you know hold it together with duct tape if you have to before I get out of here so he's at the same time he's acting like the most anti-establishment president of all time when he's on the campaign Trail he's also the most deeply Pro establishment candidate in terms of or president in terms of what he's actually doing so it's a fascinating Dynamic that's going  on right now it's a giant hustle that's right it's a giant hustle and let listen man and other people on the left might disagree with me on this but I think he's fucking brilliant at it I think he's brilliant at this part of it where he really does have a way like he broke every single political rule that ever existed when he ran for president and he won so what does that tell you that tells you that the girls are not sending the problem is who is he running against I don't think that would have worked he was running against Obama I think Hillary such a deeply flawed candidate and so  people despised her and during the me to era like her creepy fucking husband is just looming in the distance like Nas for Rado I mean how many women have come out and accuse that guy of sexual assault and rape and and he's still hovering mean he's still around and that's always going to haunt her she's connected to that guy Forever on this topic I there's an amazing story so during the election remember when those  he broke of trump on video saying a grand by the pussy I don't even wait and everybody blew up and all the mainstream media Talking Heads were like oh my God it's over he's gonna drop out it's over it's done right what a trump do it that next debate this was actually low key political Brilliance instead of doing what every other politician would have done which is basically kind of given a little bit and be like all right you got me what he did he was short apology video real quick out of the way then the next night was a debate at the debate Joe he brought like eight Bill Clinton accusers yeah put them in the  audience and then he goes out there on stage and when he's asked the question the first thing he says is listen I'm not proud of what I said it wasn't a good thing what I said but what I did was just words what Bill Clinton did was actions folks it was actions so if you want to see who the real problem is he's sitting right there in the audience and the Brilliance of that move is this is politics 101 never really go on defense your best defense is a really good offense so he made it a wash all the sudden this issue which was supposed to be oh my God it's the end of Donald Trump  the whole conversation shifted to I mean damned are a lot of accusations against Bill aren't there so maybe this is a watch we just kind of move on from this topic completely that's all he had to do yeah and you see with every single Scandal the Trump's involved in you see how incredibly pathetic and ineffectual and week the Democrats are at marketing and strategizing and you see how good he is because he is no matter what it is he's going to flip it he's gonna flip it back on you so the new thing is that Ukraine thing I don't know how close you've been following this but the Ukraine thing you basically got caught on a phone call asking for  dirt on his political opponents Joe Biden he was talking to the president of Ukraine and he said it in so many words I mean he likes a there was no quid pro quo but there doesn't have to be it's implied everybody knows what you're asking for you're asking for dirt on your political opponent strawberries melting down and going oh my God man you can't do that this is violating every rule is violating every Norm this is not something any President should be doing relying on a foreign power to get dirt on your political opponents what does Trump do again goes right back on the offense and he goes out there and says I have every right as president to investigate corruption and Joe Biden is incredibly corrupt and all  I'm doing is I'm you know trying to figure out why was Hunter Biden getting fifty thousand dollars from an energy company he doesn't know anything about energy why is he getting this and so now again the conversation isn't man he Trump should have been doing that the conversation is okay sure maybe Trump shouldn't be doing that but goddamn Joe Biden's son and Joe Biden's family is really corrupt aren't they well how about the video where you saw the video where Trump released it where it was Biden talking about yeah the loan like explain that  okay so this one I'll give you what the Democrats saying I'll give you what the Republicans say the Democrats say hey man that's a misleading video because yes it's true Biden was holding a billion dollar subsidy over the head of Ukraine to fire a prosecutor but Biden wanted to get rid of the corrupt prosecutor and bring in a non corrupt prosecutor that's why he was doing what he did in holding that subsidy over their head and they say the prosecutor that eventually came into place actually investigated the Biden family more so that's why the Democrats say there's you know do your  kind of misleading by putting this out there the argument that Trump is making is well know you're holding a billion dollar subsidy over the head of a foreign government and saying you have to listen to us and do X Y and Z that's problematic in and of itself yeah but furthermore it's like it's corruption anyway we know that the only reason Hunter Biden was getting paid $50,000 a month and actually now people are saying stops at two thousand eighty three thousand dollars a month is because his last name is Martin and so it's pay-to-play corruption 83,000 dollars a month is a lot of fucking money  and this is where I think like Democrats are silly because they always find the weakest anti-trump argument possible and now they're putting a position where they have to try to say like oh the Biden's did nothing wrong at all and Trump is all bad and bottom line nobody's gonna believe that the Biden's did nothing wrong when you're getting eighty three thousand dollars a month and you know anything about natural gas right what was the justification for the $83,000 I don't even know what they give is the justification I mean the only thing I heard from I think it was Ted lieu was he's a you know Democratic Congressman was you know hey man people sit on boards and there was  strong beer which is really weak but here's the thing and this is again why the Democrats drive me crazy is like they picked the weakest of all anti-trump arguments so they wanted to use this as like oh we're going to try to impeach him over this and this is going to be the thing that we're going to hang our hat on and Nancy Pelosi even said we're going to limit the scope of the impeachment investigation to only this only the Ukraine phone call and then somebody like me I'm sitting there I'm pulling my hair out because I can actually give you like three or four super legitimate things they're impeachment worthy not that I think it's strategically make sense and we can  get into that if you want to but like the one that drives me crazy is Donald Trump has a hotel in Washington DC that he owns okay he took three hundred thousand dollars through that hotel from the Saudi government so they're funneling him money through his hotel in DC and then Donald Trump turns around and gives a multi-billion dollar weapons deal to the Saudi government as they're committing a genocide in Yemen we know they're committing a genocide in Yemen we know that we're arming them and he gave them even more weapons because he got that money through his hotel  so for me I'm looking at that I'm going oh my God this Scandal has everything it's got personal corruption it's got guns going to a vicious genocide all country what was the money for the money in the hotel okay so what they did is they had these like little Retreats at the hotel and Saudi Arabia would pay for US veterans to go and stay at these hotels and they would I don't know if it's like tours of the capital or whatever it is but they pay for these veteran groups to go to the hotel but then of course you look at it and you go  I don't know man $300,000 and the speculation as well of course they overpaid on purpose but furthermore even if they didn't Jimmy Carter had to sell his Peanut Farm when he was president because the idea was hey we're not even saying you're doing anything corrupt but just the fact that you have this personal private business it is theoretically possible that foreign governments want to give you money through your peanut farm so you have to sell it because just the existence of it enough it is enough to say it violates the emoluments Clause of the Constitution  Fusion which is just a fancy way of saying that the president can't be corrupt and take money from foreign governments and Trump is doing that he just is right so this $300,000 though this is for services rendered this is for hotel rooms what it was that's what they say is it's for I guess the meals and the hotel rooms and whatnot I hate to say it this way but that's not a lot of money to someone like them well you know but then what I always think about when people make that point is you have to flip it what would we be saying if it was the Clinton Foundation getting $300,000 from the Saudi government  and then Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State approving a weapons deal to Saudi Arabia and the fact of the matter is that actually is almost exactly like what happened with the Clinton Foundation because Bill Clinton was going around and giving speeches at all these you know golf dictatorships and then he was getting you know 500,000 bucks a pop or whatever it was and then Hillary Clinton was approving weapons deals as secretary of state so the see the I feel like that's a little bit more egregious because he speeches are worthless like at least the the star hotel rooms it's like real it's real food he's  meals like that actually costs money these speeches are worthless that's a in my opinion in my opinion those speeches are a transparent bribe so do you think though that a president should be able to have private businesses the foreign governments can pay him any amount of money no I don't think so I don't I don't sure but I just don't think they're comparable like I think with the Clinton Foundation I think the Clinton Foundation was egregiously gross right I think both of those things are egregiously gross and I do think it influences him I think it's  sure it's sure influences in because there's a deal are they have a deal even if it's only $300,000 which I know most people hear this I like that's a lot of money it's a lot of money to me but is it a lot of money to a billionaire don't necessarily think it is and it's also a lot of money that goes through his organization and that it costs money to make that money so how much profit is that out of $300,000 is not that much profit with $500,000 of speech that's one talk for one hour  and it costs nothing for him and he's making a half a million dollars and he did it over and over and over and over and over again and it was all under this the guise of the Clinton Foundation is doing this great charitable work all across the country and all across the world and that to me was more transparently disgusting yeah so I understand I understand why you would say that but I also think that there's a problem with it in principle so I'll just nip it in the bud no questions asked but beyond that  there's also other stuff so I'm just giving you one example there's so there's the other thing which again very few people spoke about or recognize that during the campaign Donald Trump registered eight new businesses and Saudi Arabia so again when you're running for president it's you know you're it's a public service you're trying to serve your country right and you shouldn't intertwined business with that in any way shape or form there's another one I believe he has he has a hotel in turkey and now his argument by the way is no it's okay because I transfer all this  to my kids so while I'm president my kids take run my businesses and take care of it but I think that's just a total nonsense Dodge because you're still your family is still profiting from it and here's a crazy fact Joe than this one would really just blew my mind with Trump in office in one year Jared and Ivanka made I think it was 82 or 83 million dollars in one year how through their businesses and they say oh there's nothing to see here there's no problem but then you dig into the specifics and yet again you see  he's sketchy things like Jared Kushner got like millions of dollars from Israeli Banks why and then this is the guy who they say it's okay he's going to broker a peace deal between Israel and Palestine one of the sides is given a millions of dollars you think that's going to be a fair piece ooh it's gonna be the most lopsided peace deal in history and this is the problem is that and again for the Trump example it's just that he kind of rips the mask off and shows you what everybody's doing but it's not like it didn't happen with Bill Clinton it's not like like with Barack Obama it was Wall Street  appointed his entire Administration I believe you got a list from Citigroup to you know put people in his cabinet and it's like this is the way the system functions and my opinion is it should you shouldn't be taking money from foreign governments you shouldn't be taking money from corporations because you're going to be biased in favor of those countries and in favorite like look at what happened with Jamal khashoggi and Trump I mean they killed a journalist they killed a journalist and they didn't even get a slap on the wrist it was  why again because we're so intertwined with them with business relations and he is making money from them and and where is that right now well of course what did you mocking shogi say yes as far as I know it's dead in the water that's crazy but this again look at the difference between how they talk about stuff like this when it's a US Ally verse 1 it's not a US Ally when it's a US Ally like Saudi Arabia that does it there's nothing to see here but you know if you got a similar story coming out of Iran for example who is not a US Ally or they love to go after Maduro and I'm not saying he's a good guy  guy but they go after Maduro because he's not a US allies they could harp away and all the negative things about him but we're not having a conversation about Jamal khashoggi we're not having a conversation about people being beheaded in the Public Square for stuff like sorcery Joe they kill people in Saudi Arabia for sorcery and Witchcraft and drug smuggling and apostasy if you don't think God is real and you say that and Saudi Arabia they could kill you they could cut your head off in the Public Square and we are like killing people for sorcery yes really yes they're killing people for sorcery it's crazy  the khashoggi thing is super disturbing because it seems like everybody's like well what you gonna do what you gonna do I know I mean it would have been cleaner if they just made him have some sort of heart attack or an accident or something along if there was plausible deniability in any way the way they did it it's almost like this guy wanted them to do it a certain way he wanted them to chop this guy up and put them in bags and deliver them out of the country and suitcase  has and shit whatever the fuck they did however they got rid of them you know yes it's such a disturbing decision that they made yeah and they know they're going to get away with it and again this is what happens right it's been over here they have they absolutely have only one was the murder how long ago I want last time I was on the podcast we spoke about it last time I was on the podcast was a year ago so it was over a year ago  it's just whatever again if there are a lie that means I mean they really do there's so much business that goes on between the u.s. and Saudi Arabia and the weapons deals and everything that the argument Trump trump actually made this argument in the white house sitting next to you know the Saudi Crown Prince he's like they're they're buying so many weapons it's so tremendous the weapon is they're buying any holds up like the pictures of this from Raytheon this is what he's getting this is from Boeing this is what he's getting and it's like oh my God imagine for a second it's anybody  like imagine it was a deal like that with Kim Jang Hoon he's like we're selling Kim Jang Hoon these tremendous Weapon It's Right us today who I didn't see if Kim Jong Hyun Joong geun threaten us today I think they as waiting to show you this we got here Saudi Arabia is anti witchcraft unit breaks another spell what the unit established in 2009 is charged with apprehending Sorcerers and reversing the detrimental effects of their spells in the Gulf country let me see the picture  roll up for the picture oh my God that looks like Baghdad Bobby remember Baghdad Bob from from the Iraq War we like when Iraq was getting slaughtered he was like everything's great Iraq's kicking ass yes I do remember that it's like their Ministry of propaganda guy yeah yeah like on my chalabi the guy who they wanted to be the what is when the severed head of a wolf wrapped in women's lingerie turned up near the city of how do you say that Kabuto I have no idea in northern northern Saudi Arabia this week authorities knew  they had another case of Rich witchcraft on their hands a capital offense in the ultra-conservative desert kingdom is that really what it is is that conservative boy that that term that term is like way too wide if I think both are I think the idea like liberal-conservative cast such a wide net because then people like to get sneaky and use no I'm a classic liberal yeah because it what is that what is that exactly can Republican and it's funny because there's actually when you  actually look at the textbook definition of a lot of these terms they have multiple meanings yeah so classical liberal in some instances means just like libertarian because that's what it used to mean back in the day but in today's day and age like you said it could mean your kind of right-leaning yeah it's more right-of-center right they call classical liberal is a very it's it's a it's a misleading term you know but if you if you said if you like classical liberal classical liberal is it's a it's a British term correct well I think it originally dates back  it was a way of describing libertarianism that was what they use because I think it referred to liberalizing the markets so I can look at where the role perfect yes and the exact definition for that's one of those were I hear people say that and Gobo that guy's Republican why does he call himself a classical liberal yeah it's yes my point and I don't like labels period because they're so amorphous and and people can say it you if you can ask people like did you know for example in the Democratic Primary in 2016 self-described conservative Democrats supported  any sanders over Hillary Clinton even though Bernie Sanders is literally further to the left than Hillary Clinton so again that shows people don't know labels when you say conservative Democrats though maybe they just not into Interventional foreign policy and I mean she's kind of a warmonger right and this gets back to the point of labels being so amorphous that here goes sorry Classical liberalism is a political ideology in the branch of liberalism which Advocates civil liberties under the rule of law with an emphasis on economic freedom what I was referring to sort of libertarian  libertarianism that's like less rules right right yeah you regulate the market playing yeah it'll take free market will take care of a capitalism unfettered he's the best kind of capitalism closely related to economic liberalism it developed in the early 19th century building on the ideas for the previous Century as a response to urbanization and the industrial revolution in Europe and the United States notable individuals whose ideas contributed to Classical liberalism include John Locke  like John Baptista Jean-Baptiste to say I don't know who that is Thomas Robert Malthus and I don't know any of these guys it drew in a classical economic ideas espoused by Adam Smith you know had one of The Wealth of Nations yeah you know that guy doing Adam Smith yeah yeah he's like view is like the Godfather of you know free-market thought in many ways I mean there's other ones don't get me wrong there's Milton Friedman of course and there's a Hayek and there's Von mises but Adam Smith is definitely one that cited a lot he's the one where everybody is  at the individual hand of the market place that's who they're citing when they talk about or the free hand of the marketplace or however the saying goes through this expression book one of The Wealth of Nations and on a belief in natural law you tear it you you tear utilitarianism  and progress what does that mean natural law utilitarianism and progress well utilitarianism means doing the best for the largest number of people yeah but what is natural law mean Adam Smith and one books Wealth of Nations and on a belief in natural law click on that Jimmy what does that mean we're going to go down a rabbit hole here I just  natural law of money from a book so I think what I think what it's referring to is like supply and demand and how the way the marketplace works there are natural laws as to how it works and the idea is it's always a negative thing when you try to tweak those laws it works best when you take a hands-off approach the problem with that I mean there's a lot of problems with that but the problem with that clearly is that when there has been regulation for long periods of time and you just step back you're going to have a massive period of Chaos  us until things do settle if you do let the market decide I would imagine there's going to be a period when the deregulation takes place there's going to be a lot of people to get fucked over absolutely I mean there's a we actually have quite a bit of evidence on this front because we've run this experiment like a thousand times in US history alone but as a general rule whenever you do Market deregulation and whenever you cut taxes for the very wealthy there is what's called a boom-bust cycle which means everything takes off everything seems like it's  full the good time seem like they're never going to end remember the Roaring 20s they called it the Roaring Twenties because I was like oh my God the market is soaring everything's going so well and then was followed by the Great Depression and then you saw it again actually in the end of the Clinton years because Clinton repealed glass-steagall which was a very important piece of Regulation and then under the bush years as well he further deregulate and cut taxes for the rich and what happened we had the subprime mortgage crisis and the Great Recession so as a general rule it's not like all regulation is good. It depends what the regulation is but too  you in favor of regulation of the marketplaces like arguing in favor of referees in a soccer game or whatever like you need some amount of enforcement of things that make sense like I love when Libertarians argue like you know well what even like think about would you want to have no FDA at all looking after the drugs that are out there exactly it's ridiculous and you you could sell stuff that's cut with substances that could end up killing you I mean this is actually what happened in prohibition they used during prohibition they used to make alcohol and bathtubs and cut it  it with substances that were very dangerous and so every now and then there would be a bad batch of alcohol and people would die because the way they made the alcohol had no regulation and no standards like what happens today with drugs exactly yeah and that's when I mean we could talk about I'm sure you saw what happened with that standoff between the Mexican military and the drug cartel dude they beat the government in a standoff in a battle and they ended up freeing El Chapo son well did you see when the sicario showed up and stir just start  talking to the people in the Mexican military yes and the Mexican military like hey we're just trying to stay alive here it's what we gotta do like let them go and they like okay and let's go listen it's such a tough situation because the the drug cartel was just going to start massacring people yes if they didn't release them so if you're the president of Mexico if your ammo what do you do I mean if I'm in his position I go hey man I can't have you doing a genocide in a village in Mexico and they're under resource there's no right people and the Mexican cartel has an Unstoppable amount of  money Jill the only way to defeat the cartels to legalize tax and regulate drugs yeah because that's how you put them out of business they can't compete with legitimate businesses they can't compete like let's say we had all these growing operations in the US and it was legal at a federal level in the United States what is somebody going to want to do are they gonna want to go to a back alley with the sketchy character to get some drugs are they going to want to go to Walgreens well I have the author of hidden war on the podcast his name is John Norris and John Norris he got a job initially as a game warden because you know he  open the outdoors and fishing and hunting and things like that and you wanted to be a game warden well along the way they started finding these Mexican grow-ops he's cartel grow-ops all over California and it got even worse believe it or not when they made marijuana legal because now these grow-ops are just a misdemeanor it's no longer a felony so if you have a hundred acres on public land that you've decided to revert this take the water from this Creek and send it down there and it kills a bunch of fish and  and they it's just a misdemeanor for the guys growing the drugs so there's more doing it yes is more doing it and now 80% of all the illegal marijuana that's being grown and sold in the United States rough estimate is coming from these cartel grow-ops and a lot of them are using these pesticides that are very fucking dangerous right yeah see see it's because they could just do it they just set up shop and you know they go to the National Forest they go to public lands they hiked in with like fucking tubes like hoses and shit on their  so they can revert these Creeks or divert these Creeks rather and they set up these grow-ops and they bring guns and they fucking set up shop and so These Guys these game wardens became like a paramilitary operation they had to go in there with DOT scary dudes and they they had to get trained tactically and these guys wound up being these people that had to take down members of the cartel that's super scary woods yeah and I think that we have this weird gray area situation in the United States right now where  certain states have legalized it for recreational use suit and certain states have it for medical use but at the federal level it's still illegal right and it became legal then this cartel operations would have to go out of business they absolutely yeah wouldn't be valuable wouldn't be valuable they have to move on to something else and then that would open a whole nother Pandora's Box because what do you do let's say you only legalize tax and regulate marijuana well then they might just move on to there might be more cocaine or more whatever it might be but they're doing that with math there they figure out a way to grow man  with plants they figured out a way to make meth with plants this is a new thing they haven't been able to do this before methe had always been done with which another thing we need to talk about Sudafed what a good conversation that is the finished on this one Edgerrin these two when you go to in California at least they've got a cold and you want to buy some strong over-the-counter cold meds you have to give your driver's license and the  read and they only sell you a little bit the reason being is because people used to just buy everything off the shelf throw it into a basket bring it up to the counter and they would use that stuff to make meth with because it's one of the ingredients right actually boil it all down I don't know the process but you can make meth at a cold medication well these fucking guys have figured out how to do this shit with plants now okay so this is what we were going to get to in a minute yeah to we'll get to that go to that go to that okay that plant-based math is next Frontier of  Stan's drug trade so investigators have uncovered a burgeoning local trade in the production of methamphetamine using a mountain shrub see like now let me ask you this question because I'm a little torn on this next one but I'm of the belief that if you like let's say you legalize lower-level uppers or amphetamines okay so let's say you have a more benign version of all of these kinds of drugs that are legal and available we do it's called Adderall there no but yourself go to doctor and get a prescription  or that I'm talking about over the counter right okay so do you think that because I think that would not fully eliminate the market for the much harder stuff but it would I think eliminate a majority of that market because if somebody yes right because somebody goes and gets you know a more safer Alternatives that might not be a strong but you can go get a safer alternative or get a bunch of a safer alternative then yeah why wouldn't you choose that over doing like crocodile the one that melts off your skin if you do it for like a heroine one that's like a heroine but bead ones  the ones that are interesting because their productivity drugs and that brings us to Trump let's do it this is so much fun there's a there's a photograph of him which of classic photograph because it's after I love Mexican yeah he was talking shit about you know the wall and it's all rapists and murderers that is I think this was Cinco de Mayo if I remember correctly so easy in the taco bowl and the bowl says I mean he says I love Hispanics I think and I remember watching that while looking at that  photograph going sis motherfucker for real he really tweeted that I love Hispanics and he's eating a fucking taco bowl well the open desk drawer somebody focused in on it they realized this is like years later they realized that it's all filled with Sudafed and Sudafed is again the active ingredient that you know one of the one of the ingredients in Sudafed is the active ingredient in meth and so apparently people take Sudafed and if you take that stuff it gives you like a little  bit of a buzz and if you take large doses of Sudafed it's essentially like taking like he's micro dosing so can dosing meth it's actually a little deeper than that which makes it even funnier keep it yes because there's a certain form of Sudafed that they sell in the United States and then there's a UK version of Sudafed and the UK version of Sudafed has that ingredient to it which is more more of an upper Arch kind of acts like an amphetamine who give this it says the desk drawer full of Sudafed including boxes in New York perk purchase on the UK  indicate you up see that the legal limits of purchase are being circumvented and that the then candidate Trump was abusing Sudafed for its high rather than its decongestant effect okay so there's that now I want to take it a step further because I don't know if you watch this video I sent you a while ago but I was absolutely floored by the contrast between the speech Trump gave at CPAC this year and then the speech Trump gave it the UN this year the CPAC one Joe  totally Off Script bouncing off the walls and hour and 30 minutes has moving all over the place so active so engaging making jokes all this stuff hilarious and then you go to the UN speech Joe he's talking like this yes says and he literally he was so tired he couldn't even say the word sovereignty he quit halfway through it he was like and that's why we need to protect solvent yeah and so I if you want to pull that up Jamie if you want to watch some of it you can see the contrast Hackman's  show pakman had David pakman had an episode where he was concentrating on this alleged drug use by Trump and he showed the contrast of him sniffing at the debates with Hillary Clinton yet we did a yeah this whole conglomeration of all of his sniffing moments this and let me just say in Trump's defense If I Was President I'd be taking some sugar to because that's a tough job and also  don't lie when he does a rally and he's high as balls on an upper yeah they're entertaining oh yeah and I'm the first one on the left to admit his Twitter feed I feel bad sometimes because he genuinely makes me laugh he jet I remember I'll never forget the morning I woke up and I go on Twitter which is like part of my morning routine and the first words I see here from the president of the United States and it says washed up psycho Bette Midler and I just saw that first part of the tweet and I broke down laughing it was the funniest thing it makes me laugh all the time he's done a bunch of  shit on his Twitter that you just like this motherfucker is crazy yeah what was the ones that we were talking about recently that he did was it a you tweeted something was bullshit yeah I don't remember what he was saying was bullshit but like that he tweeted those words was pretty funny yeah yeah well his trumpism like the little side things that he always does make me laugh like the all-caps randomly yeah or sometimes they'll capitalize letters for no reason in the Tweet well it was great when he was the fucking host of The Apprentice yeah that's when it was great it was like he was a sinner  any character it's just now that he's the president is like wow wow wow this is real yeah I mean I'm I'm curious what percentage of the population is like my mom who really values the idea of somebody kind of being button down and presidential and very professional sounding because that used to be the model and that used to help you in the 1980s and 1990s but I genuinely feel like in today's day and age we've kind of like evolved out of that and you're not going to get another Mit Romney style politician who's like a robot who's really on script you're going to get either a left  wing version or right-wing version of somebody who's really kind of shooting from the hip and has no filter because that no filter is MM comes across is just so much more genuine even if he sounds fucking crazy when you talk even if he sounds fucking crazy right I think that's also the same thing with news that's the same thing with news reporter that's why I'm here Joe exactly right and that's why your show works too so your you talk like you're talking right now absolutely like I mean and we would be going to dinner tonight we would talk the same way that's right yeah and that exactly that  exist anywhere else and you would see these people that are buttoned down and then you'd find out behind closed doors they're freaks you know and then this is leads everybody to wonder like what what is real what is real that's right someone does talk real and then like I'm pretty sure that is who that fucking guy is like he's that way all the time that's why he's talking that way so with Trump the like okay at least I know what that is I need that's a crazy guy who's on speed and he wants to make a lot of money and it doesn't want to yell as Saudi Arabia because  because he's making money off of them okay Weiss I know what that is with Clinton like especially her like you don't know what the fuck that is you get the sense that there's multiple layers of analysis like and she said it and this was released from Wikileaks there's a public position and a private position well when the whole table legalization thing she called Tulsi gabbard of Russian asset and I was like what like what do you do what is this like well let me tell you something man gotta have fucking proof If you are a person who never stopped  but I know but in when you're saying something like that that's such a fucking important thing to say like that's a that's a very damning thing she's a major in the military right now she's in the military yes right like yeah well she's a runner has a duty Russian asset and done two tours of Duty in the Middle East and you know why they say that too right because Tulsi gabbard has spoken strongly against intervention in Syria war in Syria the argument goes  Rose hey Vladimir Putin and Russia are aligned with the Syrian government their allies therefore if you're arguing against us intervention in Syria your argument benefits Putin that's how their argument goes on they also say and this turned out to be totally debunked and not true oh there's an army of Russian trolls that are trying to help Tulsi gabbard when the election and Joe but this is the thing that they pull out for anybody who's on the left and anti-war this is what they pulled I've been accused of it before I've been accused of being a Russian puppet and a Russian asset and it's like  no you controlled opposition yeah my controlled opposition and the funny thing is Joe they do this because they cannot actually have a conversation with me and and disagree with me when I talk about policy rights of course so I when I sit there and I explain hey here's y Medicare for all the way to go and here's why a public option is nonsense and here's why our current system is terrible they want to defend the status quo but they cannot defend the status quo using arguments so you have to just let me off and put me to the side and say well he shouldn't even be allowed in the conversation because he's a Russian asset and he's not serious but the thing is  the reason why their argument holds some weight at all is because of the IRA the internet research agency and that the the the work they've done that was exposed the Russian stuff where they're making all of these different Facebook Twitter and Instagram accounts and they're using them to start to start wars like essentially to start arguments with people about anything and everything to slander people to support people you know to say you know as a black woman I could never support Hillary  and then they make these arguments and it's not really a black woman's account it's a Russian it's part of this Russian research agency that Renee direst exposed you ever if you're a pay attention to any of her work no I haven't but I'm very skeptical on this point because they always make it seem like if that didn't happen that we'd all be hunky-dory holding hands and getting along did not necessarily saying okay but but they are saying that this was effective in there's a millions and millions of engagements and it flavors conversations and for a lot of people and this  giant percentage of people they do not have time to deeply research and understand these things thoroughly they don't no one does they have jobs and they have mortgages and they have children and they have hobbies and their friends and and they're doing all kinds of shit on you know when they when they have their time off they don't know not enough time to truly research like was Ted Cruz involved in the Kennedy assassination or what I mean like when you hear a rumor like that those kind of crazy  dick ulis rumors they just they just spread it just retina and they spread primarily because most people don't have the time to look into these things so if you have something like the internet research agency that's been shown to start a bunch of accounts like they have black lives matters accounts they have separatist Texas separatist accounts where they want you know Texas to succeed for the from from the union and to start their own nation and then they have these pro-muslim accounts and then they have these  all these different accounts and even organized meetings well they'll have like the pro Texas account meeting across the street from this Muslim meeting and they'll do it on purpose they'll do it just to try to get people to fight and they have these two different Facebook pages at the running and they're running them with these propped up ideologies they're pretending that they're this they're pretending there are black lives matter organization or they're pretending that you know they're Porto Ricans  Trump like it's all its but it's Madness it's all just starting fights and causing these arguments and right and that they're doing this to try to even if it's 1% or 10% if they can distrupt democracy by 4% 5% here there it's incredibly effective if they can get a narrative going and they can sustain that narrative a bullshit narrative just through you know coming up with these fake think it has an affect how much of  of an effect I don't know but it's ineffective it's 1% if it's 2% if they can get a meme past people and you start spreading it through Facebook and a lot of them she said she looked over a hundred thousand memes and she's like some of them were fucking hilarious and you're reading these and you're laughing and you realize well they're making these things to to make people laugh and also to try to get a point across and that point is to you know to try to paint Hillary Clinton as of this or paint Joe Biden as of that or paint you know  what they're doing is they're starting these groups and these groups will argue against other groups and people just kind of go along like sheep and they don't even know who's behind the whole thing yeah really think this black lives matters group is like African-Americans that are you know tired of police brutality but it's not it's these guys in Russia they're just starting shit see but that weird see I hear you but at the same time the thing that is has kind of shocked me is  is the degree to which this is relied upon and used as the scapegoat to not talk about sometimes things that are very real issues and I know because it's been done like they said with Bernie Sanders there was this Russian troll Farm meme created of Bernie Sanders it's like he's like rainbow colored and he's doing like a you know opposed we're showing his biceps or whatever and like that was then used by mainstream media to say why is why is Russia trying to prop up Bernie Sanders why is he trying to prop up Bernie Sanders so  try to make it seem like oh Bernie's like a Russian puppet in a Russian asset and if you support him well you've just been duped to support him and so it's kind of used as this like catch-all thing where it's like if I try to bring up a real issue they say well Russia wants you to talk about that while you're talking about this this is three-dimensional chess though this is part of the whole dispute part of the whole dispute is you see something like that and then people say why does Russia want Bernie Sanders to be present while they Pump It Up Bernie Sanders and then this becomes even  a more confusing argument like if they do do something like that and they create these funny memes and try to prop up Bernie Sanders and then the argument comes in like why does Russia want Bernie Sanders to win your everything's getting convoluted everything is Muddy nobody understands what the fuck is going on that's the point the point is to sow seeds of doubt and to sort of disrupt democracy the point is to do this very cheaply and easily through internet accounts yeah this is the  hide it and if you listen to Sam Harris has podcast with the resta or the podcast that I did with her and she when she goes into depth about this you know understanding this and how much time she spent researching this I ra this internet research agency in Russia and all the work that they do we have people working 24 hours a day on this shed and they're doing it specifically under the behest of the government to try to fuck with democracy I just think we have to be really careful point taken I just think we have to be really careful  careful to make sure that that doesn't distract us from focusing on issues that really do matter because often times I've seen that's invoked to kind of shut up the talk about real issues and I'd also add on top of that as well the Dirty Little Secret that we never talked about in this country is that we actually doing the exact same thing but for sure yeah sure and it I remember that they created like a whole fake website or a whole fake app it for Cuba is supposed to be like Cuba  version of Twitter and we should all us created it was all trying to control the narrative yeah I remember the story from about two years or so ago and what was it like all fuck America well I'm not sure some rules I'm sure know they were trying to capture they were trying to say like who doesn't communism shock isn't an awesome to be subversive don't you like your time I kind of get it I'll brooch Grassroots Uprising against the government they're doing it for Cuba not doing they were doing it to try to make what they think is you know free Cuba u.s. secretly created  Cuban Twitter to stir unrest and undermined government I mean this is listen this is a tool right there's hundreds and hundreds of tools they use isn't it sad that this is what like unfortunately in so many ways this is what politics has become because you and I can sit here and we could have a really good conversation about the minimum wage what are the pros and cons of it what are the polls say on the minimum wage you know if we went down that path how would it impact the broader economy we could have a conversation about unionization we could have a conversation about health care we could have a conversation about foreign policy  and you and I can bounce ideas off each other we could talk about Market regulation all this stuff but like that's just not what dominates political culture in today's America because you just have this dumb down conversation where the entire conversation is about stuff like this or the entire conversation is about the the individual Cult of Personality aspect of politics yeah and that's just really upsetting to a guy like me because if we actually have that conversation on policy I think there's so much more agreement in this  tree Than People realize you know and oftentimes what I say is if you and I sit here and have a conversation we agree on something that's you know it's a pretty damn good bet that that's a solid position that a lot of people agree with but if to politicians in Washington DC agree on something look out because often times not always but oftentimes they're going to screw you and that's what just happened with again this was about a year or so ago there was all these headlines bipartisan consensus and agreement on a piece of legislation it was all like flowery happy  they agreed to further deregulate Wall Street which again is the thing that led to the subprime mortgage crisis in the Great Recession and this is what you get agreement on between Democrats and Republicans in Washington DC every now and then you'll get two good things like you know Bernie Sanders and Rand Paul coming together a Bernie Sanders and likely to agree war is bad and we shouldn't a genocide in Yemen okay that's wonderful we all agree that but most of the time it's like let's agree to further help out Wall Street let's agree to further artificially prop up us institutions let's go  to Wall Street bailouts let's agree to more funding for the military industrial complex and it's like it would we would be so much better off if and this is an idea that I've been pushing for a while now imagine we had a law where every time we had a to vote in a presidential election the people got to vote directly on the top three issues impacting the country and that became law so let's say in the next presidential election one of the questions is what's a national direct ballot initiative law and one of the questions could be should marijuana be legal tax and regulated at the Federal  Evel yes or no and then the American people vote on it and whatever we say that becomes law so then would be you know be like 65 percent favor of it and so we went on that one and you go down the list and you can have the three most important issues and that's a wage I think to circumvent the corruption in Washington DC I mean one way is you got you can fight to get money out of politics so there's not as much corruption that's what I think that's honestly a longer and harder fight but if you do this National direct ballot initiative law I really think that that could impact this country for the better and it's an idea unfortunately nobody's really talking about it yet  anything like Bernie's I'm with Bernie on so much of what he's talking about and I love the guy but he hasn't spoken about this yet Tulsi hasn't spoken about this yet Andrew Yang hasn't spoken about this yet and again these are brilliant people who have great idea they discussed the never publicly they never brought it up they've never bought her up I actually brought it up in conversation to somebody in Bernie Sanders campaign I brought it up in conversation with somebody tells his campaign and I do think that I'm not and I'm not saying that to go after them because I do think that they're really smart and write on a lot of stuff and I think that in due time they might see this position and  only like it and maybe Champion it but it kind of in the same way the Andrew Yang is now going around and his whole thing is universal basic income and he's kind of putting that into the mainstream of society and now we're seriously talking about it he's also doing it with drug decriminalization which I respect him for he goes beyond everybody else and saying decriminalized all drugs so in the same way that he's popularizing these things and Shifting the Overton window I'm really looking forward to some politician stepping up and and popularizing this idea because it's such a simple idea it would be so easy to implement and Joe  think of the positive effects of this I mean I remember there was a pole I think it's in the teens like something like sixteen percent of Americans still support the Iraq War which means like everybody's against it imagine if we got to directly vote on that we'd be out of Iraq tomorrow but do they understand the implications of pulling out of Iraq better than the shitty politicians who are corrupt and bought by Raytheon and Boeing and Halliburton right that's what I would say there's gotta be someone who could advise someone who has an objective perspective on foreign policy maybe someone who's in the  military who's got boots on the ground who can tell you okay here's the problems of pulling out and here's the pros of pulling out and here's the cons and get an objective analysis of the situation so at least people are informed instead of just having them vote on it based on public perception have them vote on it based on something here's what I'm afraid of when all you have is a hammer everything looks like a nail and what history teaches us is that spent and this happened endlessly in Vietnam presidents came and went and they were like  you know I don't know I really don't think we should be doing this and they would be talked into staying and increasing troop Levels by the generals right and this is not taking a shot at the generals this is just me saying that when that's your field of expertise yeah that's what you're going to say oh just let us stay there another five months let us stay there another year Joe we're at the point now where nobody even bothers to Define what victory would mean in Afghanistan would Victory would mean in Iraq the rigid think about it what's the original reason we were given all we gotta go into Afghanistan because we gotta get Al-Qaeda because Al Qaeda attacked us ok that's understandable Osama Bin Laden's dead he's been dead for so long  there's only a hundred Al-Qaeda members according to our own intelligence agencies still in Afghanistan why are we there I think it has a lot more to do with the trillions of dollars of mineral wealth it's there again I think it has a lot more to do with geopolitical power in the and the chessboard of US versus Russia I mean that you know the Soviet Union was there back in the 1980s and like this was we wanted to counter their influence in that region and again with Iraq oil had a lot to do with it as well the military-industrial complex were you know war is a racket is Smedley Butler said you can make a lot of money going down this road so  that's Smedley Butler war is a racket scary I encourage anyone to read that that was from 1933 so it's old and he was right he was right back then yeah and look at Eisenhower's ideas of what war was for and that really he was just really making things safer for the bankers that's right and look at Eisenhower Eisenhower a Republican president when leaving office warned everybody look out for the military-industrial complex because people will want to do War because war is a business yes so you can actually become very wealthy if  perpetually in a state of War I mean look how much again the defense industry in this country Raytheon Boeing Halliburton their jobs tied to the defense industry in every state in this country that makes it so hard because even if your nominally an see War as a politician you can still say well Hey listen man I agree but I don't want the jobs in my district to go away right and that is an issue that is an issue politician that's the last thing you ever want to do and have that against you when your opponent is you know saying listen this  whole pulled out and this is why you lost all these jobs and this is why the economy is in the shitter I'm going to bring those jobs back I'm going to reinvigorate the military I'm going to do you know and there we go again so again anyway so the argument in favor of a national direct ballot initiative law like a kind of a direct democracy right idea I thank you I love the idea and I really do think that even though I take your point that it's not like that you know the people are always right but I would say they're way more likely to be right that a bunch of  robbed asshole politicians for then you gotta wonder if the corrupt down so politicians are going to make these propaganda campaigns to support whatever idea would since then we've seen it many times before helmet Joe that's a giant issue I mean we've seen that when it comes to because most of the time with these direct ballot initiative laws at the state level the side that is in my opinion better wins but sometimes there's propaganda campaigns where they run these totally misleading ads yeah about what's going to happen I know this happened in one of the states when it came to either  recreational weed or legal weed they ran these misleading ads were they kind of flipped it and made people think oh if I vote Yes on this I'm legalizing weed but it was all the way around how the fuck they do that that's what I'm saying is they have all these tricks up their sleeves and Ohio is the dirtiest one right Jamie what was the deal with Ohio where they were trying to make it legal but it's here I don't remember the exact thing but I was hearing was that they had it tied up so that only like four business of monopolies yeah like for like forever forever that I got I don't know if it was forever forever but like for a long neck  not like you could it's legal but you have to buy it from me you can't even grow it yourself like what imagine if they did that with tomatoes okay we're going to have tomatoes legal in Ohio but you can only buy them from like what the fuck and the Tomato it grows in the ground how can you stop people from if it's legal it's legal you know I mean there's no laws against you growing anything that's legal right right yeah well there shouldn't be there probably are like so weird rules and regulations on it right some sneaky shit just a Zine for business  right and that's the thing is like that is just rank corruption you and I both know that the reason that came about is because whoever was in charge of the business that was getting that contract yes knew the person in government probably funneled the money for his campaign yes and that's the honestly Joe that's the root of all the problems the root of all the problems is the money in politics it's the corporations paying the politicians it's the billionaires paying the politicians and if we can have this thing called clean elections which just means that every election is publicly financed been in a situation like that you would actually  see elections run on competing ideas and philosophies and you wouldn't see elections run on competing special interest because right now you can say Okay Democrats who gives money to Democrats unions give money to Democrats so that's an issue some environmentalist groups give money to Democrats so I would argue those special interest or a little less scary but also I mean Wall Street the military-industrial complex also gives the Democrats not just Republicans right so you have these competing special interest going at it and really you're just trying to determine which group of special interest is going to run the country for the next four years and it be  so much better if we have like I would love to have debates with people who just actually flat-out disagrees me if you had me and Ron Paul here and him and I argue about economics is he's a Libertarian and I'm not I believe in social democracy it would be an awesome conversation we can actually disagree on the substance and really nail down where we disagree and why and let the people make their mind up yet politics would be beautiful if that was the case but what's interesting is it's always going to be dependent upon a single individual personality people find appealing the mean that is tough where are we  are as a country yeah I mean and this is and when someone gets chopped down boy they get chopped down like Kamala Harris when Tulsi gabbard took her out of the hamstrings that's a wrap baby Tulsi good salute you for taking down calmly dude sheet everybody was saying she's the one she's going to run it and talk even thought she would have a stronger run than she did and she did L upon but did you see how she tell she made her fall apart it's fascinating she just shrunk into the Shadows like oh and your little dog too she's  you know did you see the last debate because that was like peek okay she's done now oh yeah because what was her main issue it was so hilarious to watch this her main issue that she decided I'm going to take a stand on this in the debate Trump with Twitter was she was begging Elizabeth Warren why don't you support Banning Trump from Twitter I mean we're talking about two different sets of rules the most powerful men in the world is violating the terms of service you think that that was something to hang their hat on she's surrounded by absolute morons who are democratic strategist in Washington DC and they  think okay you have to outflank Elizabeth Warren on her left on some issue so use this issue and try to make it seem like you're standing up for the little guy and you're standing up for a rules apply even thing because Joe I know man because even to people who are on the left that looks like you're just begging for the mods like the real problem is she never did deny what Tulsi said and she can't oh you're about record and how terrible her regular the record was awful the fat  absolutely what she did with schools is the most discussed truancy thing yes well the truth is bad single moms with jail if their kids didn't go to school and she joked around about it at these meetings she joked around about it and did in conferences you know about how she cleaned it up and she just had cops knocking on the door haha you know it was there it was bad to stir being yeah what was even worse is there was somebody who was found not guilty on something they were wrongfully imprisoned  found not guilty on something when it came back up and then Kamala Harris didn't let him out and kept him in on a technicality and said all your paperwork wasn't filed in the proper time frame or whatever was on purpose herself she answers yes this is the story that broke and why did she do that I don't know I have no idea but this is one of the things that you know Tulsi was shining a spotlight on one of the things it tells you said which they use them for cheap labor for the State of California and she didn't deny any of that  she says her record is abysmal on this stuff I mean there's no there's no defending using that she got to this prominent position without any that being exposed and Tulsi exposed it just like click turn the lights on we'll look at the Steve minuchin thing this is one that we've known for a while so Steve minuchin was part of Goldman Sachs he was also the head of One West Bank here in California and what happened was they were during the subprime mortgage crisis in the Great Recession they were illegally foreclosing on people early and kicking them out of their homes in violation of the law and so Kamala Harris  you know it was recommended by her own office you got to prosecute this guy look what he's doing she didn't do it why because he's a big Democratic donors and he was giving money to Democrats at the time now by the way just in case anybody think so this is just a partisan issue and only the Democrats are bad Steve minuchin is in the Trump Administration yeah look at him he's hilarious so it's a big club and you ain't in it is the point to steal from George Carlin remember when her the his wife was taking all these fucking Instagram photos while the shit she had on private jets and stuff they look like Bond villains  oh gloves on their bond villain he's got gloves on holding money with the gloves of the fuck where's those gloves that go down to your elbows if you look down villains yeah thank you come on she's holding up money she probably feels dirty holding up ones who but the fact the fact that she's wearing those goddamn gloves like oh my God and and the fact that she looks like she should be fucking a football player she doesn't live in shipping she should be fucking mascot a gazillion dollars so it  that's why kind of hilarious right when you look at the disparity and Beauty well these are the got Joe these are the assholes are really run the economy Goldman Sachs really runs the economy Goldman Sachs it was proven that they committed fraud at a massive level what they would do is I'm going to order us a coffee if you'd like one I'm sure I'll take one with our coffee machine hold on a sec okay so I'm playing so anyway Steve minuchin Steve minuchin and Goldman Sachs it was found that in the lead-up to the subprime mortgage crisis and the Great Recession here's what they would do Joe they would sell to unsuspecting clients these  judges these packages of subprime mortgages but they were rated Triple-A and they would sell them these packages saying hey man listen this is a great long-term investment it's safe you're going to make a lot of money at the same time Goldman Sachs was doing that they would turn around and bet on those packages that they just sold as if they were awesome they would bet on those packages to fail so that's fraud they were making money in two different ways I'm going to sell you the package and make money okay and then on the other hand I'm going to bet on this same package I just sold you to fail that's like a car salesman saying I'm going to sell you this car and this car  works wonderfully everything's getting car amazing car tremendous car the most unbelievable cars race cars are really so it's like fingers down salesman doing that Joe and then the salesman also betting his buddy that that car is going to break down before it gets out of the lot right so these are criminals show and the thing is it's Democrats and Republicans were propping them up the Wall Street bailout cost 14 trillion dollars why is it we could spend money on that but we can't have an infrastructure deal that gives our country an A+ infrastructure I want to have the number one infrastructure in the world you had  Elon Musk on not too long ago he's working on this thing called the hyperloop yeah the hyperloop is supposed to be the future of travel where you kind of get in a pod and it's vacuum-powered you can go from New York to LA in like three hours or whatever it is on the ground I want why don't we have that everywhere in this country why don't we have bridges that are fixed why don't we have awesome roads why can't we go to airports and feel national pride and say this airports absolutely beautiful some are beautiful Detroit actually has an amazing airport it's know that I had no idea now it's like an airport from the future Detroit has these fucking in interior  Rams like you're inside and a train is above you flying by like whoa oh that is kind of what I like this shit Smith from the future that is kind of crazy I have no idea about that know yeah but I came from LaGuardia New York is not cool that's the worst I came from JFK though thank you look Marty is number one worst and number two is LAX LAX is number two shittiest air horn X is pretty bad well it's even worse now that they told the Uber guys that everyone has to meet you at like a lot so people like well fuck Uber so now  he's parking in the Lots now good luck trying to find a parking spot in the Lots yeah it's dude it's a disaster I was flying at a terminal to the other day I had a park in terminal 6 yeah I'm almost missed my flight I had to walk a half an hour I was running I had a run told Monica goes it's so bad there's you all of them were blocked up they have like no more parking spots signs on all of these different different languages so outdated man airports in general like it's time to evolve to the next  next thing you know like is it we're all sick of that it's a whole day to travel somewhere and even if it's just a two or three-hour flight yeah But if you go to Burbank it still smooth glass I've never been to that airport it's one of the higher end it's like oh it's not hiring it's fucking Southwest no one goes well we were saying they should have a fly at your own risk Airlines and actually I'm stealing a joke from Bill Maher because he came up that a while ago because when we were coming through TSI left Nashville to come here cuz I was a political on there and we have to wait on this line for TSA and it was just  never ending and it's like they just opened up a line and said hey man listen plane might get blown up but go right ahead I would have taken that option at the time do you have TSA Pre and clear no I don't I don't fly too much I fly to come see you and that's it that's it well you got to get clear clear is the bomb diggity you don't have ID well there was a line for the pre-check to but clear is not okay that's different okay yeah of clear you pay for it and you just put your fingers on the little screen T it pulls a picture oh here's Kyle and then you go gone through  when will Joe Rogan get a private jet as my question like flat-out own one that seems like that's there's a problem with insulation right as a celebrity period if you're a famous person it's you're already have a problem being insulated from regular folks you don't have the same sort of financial problems regular people have and then you insulate yourself further when people are always trying to get pictures with you and talk to you and they don't let you just be yourself you can't just hang so you cross  so over this weird little area soon as you cross over fully now I have a staff drive me around and I have a private jet and who the fuck are you yeah you're not you're no longer a man of the people however if anybody can pull it off I think you could if you had a private jet everybody be like oh cool Joe has a private jet but if some you know other famous schmuck did it people be like fuck that guy hmm I think I do think you could pull it off and also I mean let's be honest private jets or so fucking cool private jet that'd be so cool what about the environment man  man well you know I think can't say anything about the environment man I think of a chat I think that when people always try to do this when it comes to the environment like oh well what have you done are you using a plastic straw gotcha that's like a Kamala thing you know but like at the same time there's some insane fact like I think it's 76 percent of global emissions are emitted by like a hundred companies so really it's it's not people that are the problems if the companies and they need to be regulated and we can fix that moving forward that's a giant  giant percentage of the problem a little individual steps that people do to minimize their impact on the carbon emissions and the carbon footprint it's very small in comparison to corporations that's right it's very slick pissing in the ocean you're not going to accomplish anything about its author that's all these gotcha points that people want to point to when it comes to things like plastic straws and this and that you know what the real issue it's not plastic straws the real issue is how we handle waste that's the real issue how the fuck are the straws getting in the ocean in the first place  that is kind of crazy and that's the problem that garbage patch thing I haven't read about this in years but there's like a freaking like giant boy Onslaught who's been on the podcast before who's a very young guy I think he's only 21 years old right is he about 20 or 21 he's very young and he came up with a machine that is collecting garbage from this garbage patch the garbage patch is larger than the state of Texas now its enormous it's in the middle of the fucking ocean and it's like a soup of particles and particulate sand all these little  half dissolve pieces of plastic that are just swashing and you see a lot of in the surface but much of it is actually below the surface and you know fish are eating in there filling their bellies and birds eat it and it's just absolutely disgusting all right we got some coffees here this is tumeric coffee it's got tanks brother is it work now shitted beautiful thank you I don't let's see if I like weird looks perform Eric this is Larry simpleton turmeric yeah it's actually got an r in it yeah I don't know so I would have said  tumeric and lie to me too until they installed it's fucking machine here  pretty good right that is very good yeah that is very good little hot but very good yeah so what's going on here Jamie what is this there's this an illustration of the garbage patch yes is this is there I don't know if this is their new machine but the Interceptor I believe is what I've seen in a couple tweets here they have one currently on the way to the Dominican Republic well if you go to his boy ons Instagram he's got photographs and videos of the thing in action and it's  like this giant sort of net collection device this is a different one is this a different machines a new one this is from his Twitter but is from his Twitter yeah okay his Instagram though has actual photographs instead of Animation that this has a touch okay yeah so that's how it works it's got like this thing and it just Scoops them all up and the idea is that they're going to be able to recycle all this plastic which is excellent yeah I think we're at the point now that we it's almost like we have no option but to  rely on technology like we have to develop technology to try to course correct here because my body was saying that especially when it comes to climate change it's like we're so far beyond the point where any casual person thinks we are that's something has to be done that's beyond just like well cut off all the missions and that's it you know what I mean right right and that's a scary thought because then we really are and you've made this point before on the podcast we're relying on like the smartest people to save us at the last minute yeah yeah I mean that is her fine that's terrifying is terrifying but they're the smartest people  we'll figure out how to make all this shit they were throwing the ocean the first place that's and they also need the guy who created the nuclear weapon remember yes yeah he's huge said that and I learned this from you he said I am become death or something yes yeah when when he saw the very first when Oppenheimer saw the very first explosion test explosion said I am become death destroyer of worlds it's a quote from the Bhagavad Gita I mean that is a fucking terrifying thing to say when you're watching the the very  first atomic bomb we have the ability to destroy the world many times over now yeah which is what I think we're ready for that no boots where we were talking about earlier today that Kim Jong Hoon threatened us yeah it was on CNN I didn't see that either but allow me to say this Joe and I might get some shift in the spot don't care this is the one very narrow area where I'll give Trump credit because there's this part of trump where it's just anti-obama is  its most raw form whatever Obama did I want to do the opposite right and show Obama apparent Will trump said he said it's him so don't know if he actually did but Obama really wasn't able to get much movement with North Korea and so Trump felt like if I can get some sort of peace to would be tremendous and it'd be amazing and I would want up Obama and so Trump has actually directly against John Bolton and Mike Pompeo and Gina haspel and all of his foreign policy advisers who are terrible neo-cons who never met a war they didn't like  Trump has actually gone against them a little bit and pushed more in the direction of trying to get peace and by the way the South Koreans are actually leading the way on that and they deserve a tremendous amount of credit and they like the idea that we're not escalating with them so this is a very rare area narrow area where I want to give credit but the thing that drives me crazy Joe is I feel like the media and the Democrats to and definitely the Republicans establishment Republicans they're trying to push him in a more hawkish Direction which makes no sense because it's like here  all admit oh my God this guy's kind of thin-skinned and he's kind of crazy and he kind of you know flies off the handle and we don't really trust him with a nuclear weapon but you want him to be more hawkish and more aggressive with Kim Jong Hoon and more standoffish like they got mad when he announced we're going to stop our our military exercises which are you know very antagonistic and done right by North Korea and is done to let them know like well fuck you up like that's the whole point of it is to let them know right and Trump's I well I don't think they're a good thing I think they're you know they work  Pence piece so he's probably should stop that and then he got a bunch of shit because you know the media was like well what did you extract from them by stopping those those drills what did you get from them as a result of it it's like you need to get anything from them and North Korea and they're going to blow some people's minds they are not in any way shape or form in offensive threat against the United States there is a zero percent chance that they would unprovoked offensively launch an attack against LA or New York or Nebraska or anywhere in fact we know and it's admitted  as much when you go to the Pentagon they know he's actually strategically just acting in a defensive way and he wants nuclear weapons as a deterrent to us aggression because this is exactly what happened with Libya where we told Gaddafi after he saw what we did to Saddam Hussein and then we told Gaddafi like give up your nooks and he was like  take them you have them and then what happened we still toppled him anyway well it was the next regime right no was Gaddafi yeah but I mean it was so you're saying it was Obama and it wasn't yeah Obama but still the point is the right is took over right wasn't it all the beautiful Rebels the point is you do with that you can't trust the word of the u.s. because we'll just flip it but we did was the rebels do it with us Aid uh-huh yeah yeah and by the way just like in Syria like we have now they're jihadists right  is the famous Clinton speech we came we saw he dies she said in an interview with laughing about it yeah that was fucking spooky that's that's one of the dark secrets of u.s. foreign policy is that we have repeatedly armed jihadists to further our own political goals and that's that happened with Reagan back because we wanted to arm the mujahideen because they were fighting against they were fighting in Afghanistan against the Soviet Union so we wanted to arm jihadist then and of course that be  came the Taliban and Al-Qaeda and so that's why I don't know if you ever saw this but there are newspapers from the UK the independent the newspaper the independent calling Osama Bin Laden a freedom fighter at the time when was this this was in the 1980s when they had or maybe early 1990s when they had pushed back the Soviet Union out of Afghanistan there were headlines calling him you know a freedom fighter when he was the head of the mujahideen when he was the head of the mujahidin isn't wasn't that where they restructured the idea of jihad that a Jihad was initially supposed  to be a battle against your own personal vices this was how it was interpreted yeah I think it's interpreted in different ways throughout the Muslim world that but anti-soviet Warrior puts his army on the road to peace okay that's what I meant not Freedom Fighter puts Army on the road to peace peace my to think about Trump's reaction to back Daddy getting caught classic Trump at the way he did it that he subscribing and whimpering like why would he say that well he was also trying to like do a dick measuring contest  the Obama did you see the speech afterwards news like listed with a I heard they had problems when it came to Osama Bin Laden but we handled this we handled it so beautifully so amazingly and the funniest part is apparently when it actually happened he was on the golf course and so after the fact they decided oh we got to have one of those like Situation Room photos like Obama did when when Osama Bin Laden was killed and so they staged the photo let's stages fuck they put all the wires there and some of them are not plugged in that photo was taken an hour and a  after it happened apparently I come on we know that for sure can pull the metadata out of the photo and find out it was taken the cameraman pull the picture up let me see the picture so funny picture well lit that's what's fucked up about his like they hired fucking Annie Leibovitz to come in and light the room and so many Yak the West it's lit it what picture you looking at the camera I think to is he  he's a character man there it is go go full screen app please hey kid zoom in on the wire you see one of those not plugged in you know a lot of them are plugged in but I mean also isn't it interesting too that they're still using like they're using wires yeah I mean I guess because we have to get ready you better connection to yeah you're watching video hmm right so is that each team I like what are they connected to CAT5 to tell ya writin this could be different but that's what is that look how well that's lit yeah I mean it doesn't even look like  you're all really there it looks fake it does look kind of weird that's for sure but it's funny that like at a moment like that his thought process was like I have to try to make this as you know as amazing as it is but he feels like he has to go above and beyond to do so that it can't just be on its own like okay you got the head of Isis congrats look at Mike Pence he's thinking about writing a book right there no actually okay I think that Mike Pence is actually one of the most loyal Trump people  who's least likely to abandon him yeah but I mean when Trump is out of office and has a heart attack from all the math I think Mike Pence going to be the guy that writes the book you think so I don't know man there's something about this guy so so Mike Pence a lot of people don't know this about Mike Pence but he credits his career to Rush Limbaugh because he became a talk radio host and he was so inspired by Rush Limbaugh Mike Pence was a radio host yes but look at the difference between him and Obama  and so funny clearly watching something go down  yeah it's pretty funny but yeah he's I think he's going to be super loyal to Trump even after the other thing that's interesting about the Trump era is even though he knows how to do Relentless offense and not stop attacking Democrats and not stop making his case what you're finding now is that even the other Republicans are struggling to keep up like they can't as much as Trump wants to defend himself other Republicans are now like shying away from doing it right you know well they feel the walls are closing in they do but what's interesting is  like I think there's basically a 0% chance he'll get impeached in the sense that he actually gets out of office you think you'll get impeached but you don't think he'll be removed from office I think I actually don't even know if he'll get impeached so I don't even know if it could get through the house but there is a chance it gets through the house I'll put that a 50/50 so he can get impeached through the house but he needs you need 20 Republican votes in the Senate to get him out of office and that's not happening right that's just not happening it's not possible not gonna get us what's that not for no not I would argue probably not  for 99.9% of things maybe there's some unforeseen scenario that I can think of at the moment that for some reason we make them flip on him but he can almost do anything and get away with it what's fascinating is how Democrats are so they're so invested in the idea that of him being removed that they're saying it as if it is a fact well yeah because there's there's we have it's like narrative Wars you have the one side they have their narrative about how he's guilty on all these things and it's not even an open question anymore you should be  please you should have been impeached a year ago and then there's the other side of it which is just like at least coming from Trump himself I did nothing wrong nothing wrong at all ever everything is wonderful and is all fake news and we constantly live in a state of like a tug-of-war between the two realities and yeah I mean what's amazing to me is watching the media agree with the establishment Democrat narrative when it's not like it's not going to come to fruition if you're spending all your time talking about how he's gonna get out of office he's going to be impeached that's just a pipe dream  do you remember that what the fuck's the guys name the GQ guy who had the basement show the result Keith all remaining he is the most insufferable dude on the planet man so self-righteous so smug see that's the problem in the Trump era is that Trump says Trump's a dingbat and everybody knows it but he's not pretending to be holier than thou or the guy like Keith Olbermann is pretending to be holier than thou and he puts on this you know this smug act and he starts yelling at everybody and it's like you know that you don't even want to be yelling right now reel it in a little bit man  after breaks dog pump your brakes you know you don't want to be doing this last broadcast he was saying that he my job is done with work is done and that it's days before Trump gets removed from office and that was at least two years ago right and that's the other thing is that there's so much of it when was his last show Keith olbermann's it was a while ago it was in a basement with like a cardboard backdrop it just like a fucking Ikea table and he had some notes and that's why Joe I  I think that my show is growing is because you know it's so easy to be anti-trump but you have to be anti Trump with intelligent reasons and so my arguments against him are always policy-based like there there you go over man retires from 17 it's almost exactly two years almost they don't understand how much of a cell phone this is and how this actually pushes people to the right but whenever you say something's going to happen that has not happened I mean God damn  something as important as removing the president from office but you got to be right about that there will be no Day of Reckoning on that and I promise you and I know that because remember the whole Russia gate thing the first time I was on the podcast I did a rant about the Russia gate thing where I predicted they're not going to get him on collusion it's not going to happen that's not gonna happen right I was right yes Jimmy Dore was right some others were rights I swear to God the day after we were proven right there was no in my opinion you are the most reasonable of all political reporters you make the most sense to me I  I just you have never watched one of your shows why like this guy's out of his fucking mind I really appreciate you saying that true you're a normal person like can you call things the way you see them in your informed and that is so rare man and even the fact that you're able to give props to Trump's ridiculous shit like and say that it's funny we all know it's funny yeah but sometimes you're not supposed to say it's funny but the people with the sticks up their asses they're only hurting themselves when they don't admit that right when no matter what it is they're like I'm so offended  had some recently where we were laughing really hard it was wasn't it just a small a thing it was something after that it was something after that by the way I watched alien Covenant the other day I didn't know that jussie Smollett he was in that it should help this Chappelle bit on that is so funny I was amazed so funny it was amazing that you have to live with that forever when you get taken down by Dave motherfuckin Chappelle this one of the top three comedians of all time dedicated  and 10 minutes to you and they're trying to act like there's this movement now to try to act like oh he's only accepted Now by conservatives but that's just not true so it with chili that ship out there trying to hilarious he's gonna try to make that a thing but it's just not it's just not true it's nonsense well this is this is the problem with woke culture it's it's reductionist and it's delusional it's just it's not real and they're trying to for the trying to push this narrative as if their Echo  Chambers whether it's their blogs or their Twitter groups when they have you know they have these band group so that band people that haven't even interacted with them and they're interacting with people in this bubble and they believe that this is how the world thinks that's how you get something like that Rotten Tomatoes review of Dave Chappelle's where it has 0% by 5 woke critics then they release it to the general public gets 99% there you go and it's also this spring back effect where people know you're fucking with them and then they go  okay well you guys are assholes so the people that are saying the Dave Chappelle special is bad they become the enemy and then so Dave becomes the hero and then even if you didn't like it you're going to say you loved it yeah you know and and another thing is they act like he's always been Politically Incorrect yes look at it look at Chappelle Show which was you know I was in high school we all watch the spell show and I thought it was like the most brilliant thing ever and the idea that he ever crosses some sort of a line that's Dave Chappelle the whole point is to cross the lane  there's no point of it Perpetual line step person's day one that's why he's so funny would you say Jimmy were the green land thing we wanted to buy Greenland oh that was it very special area we put the Trump to Hotel in the middle yeah I'm not gonna do this come on man I know it first of all the buying the Greenland thing is a great move if global warming is real if that becomes a part of the United States then you can go up there you don't have to worry about it yeah well they say I think that they want rights not not to Greenland but also there's a movement  in the Arctic there they want to do this to Greenland come on that shit is hilarious that is pretty funny but you gotta click on it though Jamie so you can get couldn't but oh Joe they want to do like oils really now with the Arctic rush it in that photo you have you know Twitter is the only give you like three quarters of the picture yeah they want to do oil drilling yeah but I mean I just the whole global warming is terrifying to me the whole climate change thing is terrifying to me but what's more terrifying I think than anything  that is that is a hilarious but that is that is funny what's more terrifying than anything is that we some people are resisting it and it because it's become politicized and it's some people are just buying Whole Hog into anything that gets said that supports climate change or supports the concept of climate change and that we've gotten into this thing where it's an ideologically based sort of subject okay can I try to frame it in a way that I hope I can convince some conservatives watching this yeah  yes I would love to have the chance to do that so what I would say to them is first of all there's a lot of issues that you care about that this will impact so there was a report that came out about a year ago which found that basically large swaths of the Middle East will be uninhabitable at a certain point because it would just be too hot for human beings to live there will be talking about that yesterday of Saudi Arabian summer where a lot of people from Saudi Arabia come over to La during the summer because our summer ain't shit compared to their desires so and that's the thing is  you think there's a refugee crisis when it comes to what's happening in South America you think there's a refugee crisis in Europe when it came to what happened in Syria and Iraq You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet right so if you're somebody who fancies yourself against immigration or a hardliner on immigration or against helping refugees or whatever it might be just think about what happens when you multiply What's Happening Now by a thousand okay because that's what's going to happen at some point it's just a matter of when and the other point I would make to them is this  this  people like to you know make fun of the green New Deal and try to pick it apart if we talk about the green New Deal and only Define it as basically a new new deal so the New Deal FDR you know put that into place this was tried to try to fight back against the Great Depression and try to get people employed try to fix the country right and FDR kept getting re-elected because FDR was beloved by the entire country because he was fighting for regular working people that was his thing and that's when the Republicans like geez we really should have term limits because we can't beat this guy what if  when we talk about the green New Deal we're highlighting the fact that yes we're going to move towards renewable and Green Technology yes that's going to be a large part of what we're doing but the whole point guys is millions and millions of jobs created for regular people the whole point is to improve this country to fix this country to try to make it so that our infrastructure is better than the rest of the world what if instead of looking at this is like oh my God this is going to be such a drain on the economy and what's going to happen to the deficit how about you look at this like an economic  Unity because what's going to happen in the future Joe there's inevitable patents that are waiting to be had for all these green and renewable Technologies we could lead the world on that front or we could lag behind Russia we can lag behind China we can lag behind everybody else and be stuck in you know what would effectively be a stone age so be encouraged this industry to flourish well be subsidies like how do you what do you do to get these industries to innovate and to pump a shitload of money into Green Technology it has to do with  government contracts it has to do with I mean first and foremost before we even do the right thing you have to stop doing the wrong thing which is stop giving four billion dollars a year every year as a subsidy of ExxonMobil and they hilariously say oh they need this money because it's for research and development no it's not they don't need for research development the most profitable corporations on the planet they can do their own research and development right so stop subsidizing fossil fuels and then yes what we need to do is invest in a variety of different things that show a little bit of Promise some things won't work okay some things will work and then we move forward from  Aaron so that's where you could get the hyperloop all around this country what if all this stuff was built and brought about because we did a massive investment in a green New Deal then everybody would talk about how it's a wonderful thing and how we're finally leading the world and in our rightful place I find it hilarious that you know guys like Trump and guys like Joe Biden by the way love to say like there's nothing this country can't do and then in the next sentence they want to tell you a thousand things that they think we can't do and that we shouldn't do we shouldn't even try well what what technologies have you heard if any that are being  being even proposed to mitigate global warming or climate change well there's anything there's the classic ones that I think are more effective than people give it credit for like solar is ones that's it's effective the people I don't think it gets its do but then there's other things like thorium now let me just say I'm not I'm not talking about a thorium car because it was a car that was proposed and it was apparently was total bullshit they could make a thorium car work but with thorium thorium is basically the way it's been described to me is nuclear energy without the downside of like you could melt down and destroy everything  always been described to me so a nuclear powered car no not a car we're talking about power for the energy grid not why not a nuclear problem well the thorium story that everybody got pissed over was because they were trying to make it seem like it was right around the corner they had the plans and it just wasn't and those people were full of shit but that doesn't mean thorium is bad and totally off the table it just means that that specific car they were talking about was nonsense okay but if you have thorium reactors it's basically like meltdown proof nuclear facility that's how it's been described now I'm an idiot I have no idea how  far off we are from actually developing that but I do know that we need to invest in this and other things that show potential I mean that's the only way to move forward and the nuclear thing is very interesting right because a lot of the technology that's a problem today like what happened in Fukushima is old nuclear technology well old technology that you can't really shut down but they've mitigated a lot of those issues apparently when you talk to people that are pro-nuclear when they talk about the future of nuclear power that like look the we have systems that have all this redundancy in place you can shut them down  pound they're much safer than the things that they constructed essentially in the 70s in the 60s I'm skeptical on that point and I'm skeptical because at every step of the way they told us that so with Fukushima before it happened they said oh don't worry this is this it would never happen here and then what happened was of course you had the earthquake then you had the tsunami and they were like oh we we could build a seawall high enough yeah that's like an engineering 101 mistake and I'm going to tell me you have everything figured out on that front so I'm a little skeptical when it  comes to nuclear for obvious reasons Chernobyl was a three-mile and five-mile or whatever it's called and then Fukushima but I do think that that doesn't mean I would you know ban all nuclear today but it does me I think there are better ways moving forward that are cleaner that are safer right and solar is a big one particularly in places like Los Angeles but with solar you also need batteries in The Battery Technology apparently is not as good as would need to be in place in order to power an entire city like La even though we have some  almost every day of the year you know like bright Sun very few clouds almost every day it's so nice it's very nice lucky right no now come over here like I know I'm like because now in New York it's you know you're finally getting cold cold miserable I'm going there on Thursday I'm excited dude when you'll notice this too when you've been there before but it's a you don't even realize it's impacting your mood until you come here in October November December January when I lived here when I first lived here when I first moved to New York yeah me and my friend Gary  we were like we're this is crazy look outside it's fucking so sunny it's fucking January man so I I don't think I have seasonal depression but I definitely have a worse mood you know in the winter yes and in the late fall oh yeah yeah it's that is seasonal depression that's less depressed then you could be right like definitely not rise up as you would be if it was nice out it's at the sun just gives you energy you want to do stuff you want to be productive you also get spoiled it's like the equivalent being a weather based trust fund baby  that's a great Point that's a great point you always have money so you don't worry about money well if you were grew up poor and you felt the sting of poverty and you didn't know where your next meal was coming from when you had to work really hard then when you make some money you feel great but if you always had money or spoil you don't realize it's or something you always lived in LA and never traveled there they would they're just like this is just what it is and what they don't appreciate it they are appreciated on appreciate it and they're soft they don't understand what weather is they understand they don't have a real relationship with nature and I think when a snowstorm comes  you have a relationship with nature and also there's more of a community bond with the people around you because you're all in it together mean you really have to rely on people that's very true car gets stuck on the side of the road you got to help each other like it's different it's a different feel even in place like New York City there's a bond that happens when everyone's collectively dealing with some shit particularly some nature shit yeah I've heard you say that you think you know my Northeastern people are harder the harder people yeah but it's also their the children of more direct and recent  immigrants and the atmosphere that those immigrants have created right like my parents were second generation right my grandparents were first generation they came over from Italy and Ireland yeah Grandma my mom side Italian so all those people they came over they were fucking Savages basically they hopped on a boat they barely didn't have a video to look at these fucking they know they can't YouTube or Google it just took a crazy chance and hop in the boat and coming over here from Europe right they land on the shores and they live in these immigrant communities you know they're all walking  the street to buy bread from this guy and sauce from that guy and they're all they're all they're all eating Italian food because they're all Italian they're living in these Italian neighborhoods and you know and everybody's like fucking struggling hardcore and they have this hard-ass attitude of the kind of people that would be willing to take a boat ride across the country one of the things you realize when you go to Italy vs. Italy vs. Italians in America Italians in Italy are more relaxed well that's all I'm worth Kill from what I've heard because I've actually I've been to Canada and I've been  the u.s. territory Puerto Rico I've never been to Europe yet okay and I've heard it's like they're it's a totally different culture in the middle of the day they'll just drop everything they're doing and everybody goes and eats and takes a nap and relax a little bit dude Italy is so relaxing the food is Sensational and it doesn't the weather never sucks I like the idea of that but if you actually put me in that environment I'm so used to going going going going going all the time that I might actually be like this is weird and crazy yeah you'd go crazy which is weird because I love the idea like I think for example  the u.s. is like the only developed country in the world that doesn't have paid vacation time by law like in other countries you might get like a month off in August or whatever and you do everyone in your paid here we don't have that I definitely support an idea like that but I do wonder how I'd react to that like big chunk of the middle of the day missing you don't work during that middle of the day I do wonder how I'd react to I think a four-day work week is probably a good idea though I like that idea is a great idea three days off for days on is The Right Move that's pretty if you're listening I hope Bernie's listening you think he's listening to you  you do important work we recently he's taking a nap right now I'm self okay but we have we have to say though and this is incredible right before I came in here I looked and on there's a new poll that came out of New Hampshire CNN poll nonetheless he's now leading in New Hampshire is he but that's because he's from Vermont no no but he was down before he's leading now and furthermore an Emerson poll came out he went up Five Points post heart attack Five Points he went up host hard supposed to tell them no poet no I'm telling you man I'm talking you know how you always say about adversity  like oh if you overcome adversity yes he's like the prime example that there were because I know people in his campaign and they were telling me that literally the day of by the end of the day he was like okay I'm feeling much better let's go that sounds like wishful thinking I mean that's what they were telling me was how I love you you're a great guy that sounds like wishful thinking and I love Bernie and I had him in here and I really enjoyed talking to him and thanks to you because you set that up but when you have a fucking heart attack your body's telling you something your body's telling  you hey man you fucking you need to stop red line and this engine they're making him grow back some events a little bit and he's reeled it in a solid 15 percent need to get him on steroids get them on the magic I'm getting Jack to get them on the juice get them on the shit Trump's on steroids and some form of amphetamine he's already vitamins rallies a day would be hilarious with vitamin drips all day long they should give him a vitamin drip in the morning of vitamin drip in the afternoon just changes what eise I don't know what he's eating but it doesn't look  eating the right stuff that I think they're now he's on a red very regimented thing yeah creationist not for nothing I don't work did you see the debate right after the heart attack because he looks so much better he did it's crazy it's like he knocked something loose that's right I didn't know I was being held back Joe I had a bum artery yeah well he he really did have a bum artery right he got a stent put in it but the thing that's so amazing is that he's and Killer Mike he also had on the podcast so I absolutely love he said it best he said this is the only candidate in my lifetime who's taking dr. Martin Luther King jr.  philosophy and trying to run it across the Finish Line yeah Mike loves him and I love Mike so I mean I think the whole thing about him that worries people's just his health and his age and you know and then there's people that want to label him as a wacky socialist but when he explains his positions outside of that whole debate environment we only have 30 seconds to scream right now it's and and there's a difference Joe between socialism and social democracy is and social democracies Scandinavia that's all it is so it's saying hey we're not totally  scrapping capitalism we're not going to have everything government-run all we're saying is let's catch up to the rest of the developed world when it comes to Single Payer Healthcare so everybody gets Health Care everybody gets College we're going to abolish student loan debt we're going to have Fair wages for everybody so nobody's working full-time and living in poverty and when you explain this like you just said when you explain this to everybody there like I can't believe I thought I ever disliked this guy Wells all those things are as fucking reasonable as you can get and if you're going to have a community which is essentially what it country is right we're a community  T we've got to take care of each other what's the best way to take care of each other well let's support each other so that if something comes up some sort of a catastrophic Health crisis you're covered we cover you we love you we are a community if you have a heart attack if you've got to this you got to that you need to leg fixed whatever the fuck it is you're covered for that okay well maybe we shouldn't krippw with debt when you're 17 years old you don't understand what the fuck you're doing and we get you involved in this ridiculous system where you can never get out of it  if you go bankrupt you still owe that money forever we're at a point right now in this country where people who have social security they're on Social Security to getting money from their social security taken out because they owe student loans if that's not the most desperate and gross fucking feeling in the world disgusting yeah it's crazy and we have some weird creepy Coalition I mean there's some creepy like agreement that they have with these financial institutions and these educational  matush ins where they've they're essentially financially imprisoning young kids at an early age and people say well you shouldn't make that decision shouldn't shouldn't make that decision and put yourself in debt like that okay that's great but this is that's a very unscientific perspective because you're talking about someone whose brain isn't even fully formed right yeah frontal lobe you're not even a fucking real human until you're 25 years old so let me I want to address because I can some people are going to hear what I just said about you know Medicare for all  Single Payer Healthcare and they're going to say yeah but how we gonna pay for it because that's the common one that sure bring up now let me address that because that's a really important question and usually when you actually substantively address if people go okay that makes a lot more sense how are they going to pay so very simply put the way the system works right now it costs more than if we had Medicare for all why is that because we have an unnecessary for-profit middleman that essentially acts like a mafia so what we're saying is I'm going to remove that Mafia from around your neck and you're going to it's basically  what does that Mafia you referring to a mafia is the for-profit health insurance company so they have to they have to take their cut as the middleman between you and your doctor okay if we just remove that have the government at no profit margin be the single ensure that's what a single-payer means they're the single insurer then we actually end up saving five trillion dollars over the course of 10 years and that's not Kyle kolinsky talking that's a detailed study from the University of Massachusetts Amherst now talking that's a liberal fucking place so what do you what do you do when you have  all these insurance companies like what happens those insurance companies well it's all those jobs what happens to all that money the insurance companies go away go away I mean they go Essence is go under so you kill ya if I if I say you're not allowed to cut your lawn okay unless it's let's say the guy wants to charge you $100 I say no Joe I'm going to be the one who pays the person who cuts your Lon you have to give me $200 okay so if somebody came along and said  I said no whoa whoa hey middleman guy we're gonna get rid of you and Joe you want to cut your lawn give that guy a hundred dollars and you're all set wouldn't you say well that makes sense I the middleman guy it's he can piss off because that's the way I look at it the reality is when people argue for choice and health insurance look at it like this would you say hey man don't take away my choice when it comes to picking my firefighter  people like what do you mean no the way it works is there's a fire and you get help end of discussion they will come you don't say well well well I want to pick my fire department well this is the same thing with Healthcare the idea you're gonna be able to pick your doctor that's perfectly fine okay but the idea of you'll have your choice between insurance companies that's like saying pick which much do you want the Irish mafia ripping you off for the Italian mafia pick ripping you off for the Jewish Mafia ripping you off go ahead I'm giving you a choice right right in some areas the the idea of choice is fundamentally absurd it's like saying  let's let's shut off the road system instead of being public let's have it privately run and you could turn make a left on that road make a left on that road and make a right on that road don't take away my choice of road I want to pay for that one that one that one no it's all there it's all free at the point of service and this is the whole idea of having a public utility does the whole idea of having something that's off the table in a civilized society right and again what the study show is it actually saves money so the real question people should be asking is how can we afford to keep having the system that we have right now  now because we pay more than the rest of the developed world and we have 32 45,000 Americans that die every year because they don't have access to basic health care and we have 500,000 people who go bankrupt as a result of medical bills so what you're saying is that they would it would abolish insurance companies essentially so there is one caveat to that and that caveat is what's called supplemental health insurance so what that means is if there's something that Joe Rogan likes that's a medical procedure that isn't scientifically proven yet but it's still something that  you like there would be Private health insurance companies that sell you supplemental insurance which means on top of everything that you already have through Medicare for all so if you are getting like stem cell therapy something like well steps in in an ideal Medicare for all system and Bernie believe me has gone so far above and beyond any criticism I mean his thing is airtight it gives Dental it gives Vision against everything I wouldn't be surprised if under the Medicare for all Bill the stem cells thing is covered but let's say something like Homeopathy which is like the worship horseshit total horseshit my cover that binder  it's no medicare-for-all would not cover that because it's so speculative and travel horseshit Insurance private horseshit insurance or or or plastic surgery things of that nature but that's an important point because real to have private surgery or private insurance for for plastic no no I'm saying it would be don't theoretically legal for it under a Medicare for all system because it's supplemental how could you have insurance for plastic surgery like you know I decided my ears are too big so maybe the market maybe the market wouldn't be there but you would be legally possible is the point so it doesn't fully ban private insurance but  Quinn it bans what's called duplicative care so you can't say hey I'm an insurance company I'm going to come in and offer you something that's already covered in full by the single-payer system and the reason why that's there is we don't want you getting ripped off by some charlatan that's what you saying but it was it would essentially gut the health insurance industry it would make it so that you no longer have health insurance company CEO is making tens of millions of dollars off the backs of people while people die because they can't get health insurance yes it would and that's a  good thing that's a positive thing it's a good thing for us but as a sale like to sell that well that well the thing is there's we have this issue where we have like a status quo bias where people think like well because it works how it works right now therefore the idea of addressing it and changing it seems like so overwhelming that we just kind of default to how we have it now but the problem is we know as a matter of fact that the way we do it now is the most batshit crazy way you could possibly  do it because they research this stuff all the time they study this stuff all the time and every single time they look at it the u.s. comes dead last in the developed world when it comes to health care so we finish there was a recent study from the Commonwealth fund they found that they study eleven different countries the u.s. is 11th out of 11 when it comes to health care so every other country that does the single-payer system which we were talking about and there's different versions of it there's multi-payer their single-payer there's private funding of of shooting there's Public Funding of private insurance Public Funding of public insurance but bottom line is any other way you  you do it is better than the way we do it right now mmm okay and just to be clear because some people say well what about Obamacare what was Obamacare Obamacare was originally a Heritage Foundation plan which is a right-wing think tank so that was basically Mitt Romney's health care bill Newt gingrich's health care bill and the whole idea was that of that was we're going to force people to buy private insurance right and that's an I don't like that idea at all I dislike that mess I've been very critical of Obama care I think there's a good case to make that it was a step in the right direction because  you think was better than the system that we had at the time but I would say that was just a little step on the path to what we should have which is a Medicare for all system where Healthcare is a right and not a privilege we catch up to the rest of the developed world and again we should go above and beyond the rest of the world because I can count it I don't think they have dental covered by it they don't but Bernie's Bill does provide Dental so you know I think this is one of those issues where when it's fully explain to people it's kind of a no-brainer and you can get people to realize I don't know the system is totally screwing you right now and we can fix it do you think he has a chance  chance oh absolutely Bernie Sanders you really do okay well let me ask you this are Tech absolutely I do now let me ask you this who of the Democrats do you foresee really beating him beating Trump no no beating Bernie in a primary hmm  well it's good question right it's a very good question he's got a lot of support for sure but Elizabeth Warren seems to have a lot of support right now too okay so that's your answer right Elizabeth Warren yeah I would say well Joe Biden's fuck he's too old but old in the wrong way like he's communication skills of eroded he flubs his words he looks exhausted he looks like he's just waiting for them to shut the door so you can take a big deep breath and sink into the  ouch you know what I'm saying I know exactly what you're saying and I feel it sometimes I feel bad because it appears like he genuinely has cognitive decline so he does so I don't like to make fun of it but then when he goes out there in the debate and he starts like angrily ranting and he says you know we got to play the record player at night make sure the kids hear words like that made less than no sense man what are you doing you got to wrap it up did you know that his people are actually they have a plan it's called like a limited exposure limited visibility campaign where Joe they are  literally like hiding him from the public as much as possible well they have to they have to as he's still close to the lead right so in some polls he's still leading that is hilarious eat and here's the thing and this is what I was going to get to in relation to Bernie I call the support for Biden default support So default support is people who don't necessarily follow politics that closely but they might be a registered Democrat and their ass hey who do you support in the 2000s I don't know who's running Oh by nobody was a VP of of Obama sure yeah bye  not that's the kind of support I think Joe Biden has where that is very very likely to kind of dwindle away and we're seeing it right now because when you look at the fundraising numbers Bernie is breaking all records when it comes to individual donations even out raising Trump and Trump said beast on the campaign Trail he's nothing to mess around with on the campaign Trail but he's even out raising Trump when it comes to individual donations his ground game is airtight he's got people everywhere making phone calls knocking on doors getting involved and so he has basically an endless well of in small individual donors  support and an army of people on the ground whereas Joe Biden is doing so bad that he went back on his pledge like oh I won't take Super PAC money now he's saying well if somebody were to make a Super Pac and it would help me out what do you want me to tell you because he raised nine million dollars in the last quarter Bernie raise 30 and Joe Ray's knives so Bernie happy-looking yeah it takes I love talking about politics and explaining everything I know you do but you're so Bernie happy well yeah because Joe he's a he's an amazing candidate  is trying to get the u.s. to have social democracy and he's a guy who I know because his record shows it he's going to fight for all of us even if you don't agree with him and even if you dislike them I understand that you might be somebody who's right-leaning he's too far left for you but what everybody has to say and they know it's true is he he's incredibly honest and he's actually going to fight for you every step of the way yes no I think you're right and talking to him he's a very sincere guy and I think a lot of his policies I agree with I really really agree with this whole the exoneration of  of student loan debt that that to me is a giant factor in a lot of poor decision-making that a lot of young people make because they're fucked because they have this massive debt hanging over their head it's a huge source of stress and I think it's a rigged system I think it's dirty it's a dirty system yeah the medicare-for-all think it's a wonderful idea as long as you can seek you know very talented orthopedic surgeons if you got some money always pick your doctor fixed and can always pick your doctor you know because you got to there's a certain incentive right that I think  and doctors have towards Excellence right and a lot of that incentive is financial and there the doctors that are the very best in certain particular Fields they want to charge more money for their services and I think that that should be okay that's this one of the things that helps make people more enthusiastic about Excellence its Financial reward it's a part of human nature no absolutely and that's what one of the things that people despise about the concept of socialism is  that it's going to somehow or another by you know making sure that no one makes any more money than anybody else which is like the most extreme but that's like authoritarian communism yeah yes yes but that's some I don't agree with that at all either and people who I talked to who are my friends on the left they don't agree with that at all and one of the things that we get most annoyed with is when there's like a conflation people will look at the former Soviet Union people will look at Venezuela people will look at Cuba and they'll go hey well there's that's what you want and that's what they say to us and whenever we respond oh man we're talking about social democracy we're talking about what they have in Scandinavia  there's usually no substantive rebuttal to that right other than to say and what's funny though is they will take credit for those systems in some ways so it depends if you talk to Ben Shapiro on one day he might say no no Joe those systems are so good because their capital is to an extent okay and then if I fire back at Ben and I go okay Ben let's Implement that style of capitalism kill switch it and say no no they're socialists we can't do that well what is it we have a giant problem in this country with this whole right left sit shit you know and this is what I was trying to say earlier when we're talking about yeah the concept of classical liberals because  the idea behind it I just think that to have groups of people that think in certain ways the problem with ideologies whether it's left-leaning or right-leaning is it makes you automatically predisposed to ignore or to refute the concepts that are on the other side and totally agree and so many of us share these ideas across the board and when one group is committed to one concept like one of the things that you do see this about climate change  inch people on the right are more inclined to deny the negative effects of climate change because it's part of the right ring the right-wing ideology this is something we see today I need to get so you're right but also I would just advise people don't get too lost in the noise because we can think that that's something that's overwhelming and we can't defeat it and we could also think that you know for example the whole Russia gate thing on the Democratic side yeah that was that became such a fundamentalist religion and you couldn't deviate from the liner notes exciting  that's true we got they wanted it to be true and people would believe it and argue for it even though the things weren't adding up and I was trying to point out where it's wrong but what I would say is that the end of the day people should actually be relatively happy about the fact that I think the most destroying just divide in the country is not right versus left the strongest divide in the country I've called it populist versus elitist yeah so you have elitists in the Democratic party you have a lead us in the Republican party and you have the people and the people are at we're so much more in agreement than people give  credit for you know I agree I have a thing that I go down and I did this in some of my events at Politico on as well but people would be surprised man 80% of the country wants to raise the minimum wage 58 percent of the country wants to have free college like I said only 16 percent or so of the American people want to be involved in Iraq and Afghanistan and these terrible Foreign Wars 62 percent of the country wants to legalize marijuana I could sit here and ring off issue after issue it's over 80% of the American people I want to get the money out of the political system and clean up the corruption do you think that this  country has room for other parties we are so ingrained in this idea of left versus right Democrat versus Republican and this is the choices that we've always had with the occasional independent the occasional you know Ross Perot jumps into the race and throws a monkey wrench into everything but other than that or maybe in a month to my next Point Gary Johnson but do you think there's room for other parties at this juncture so that's a great question and what I would say is first let me get my purse  we'll take on it my personal take is I 100% want that to be the case because I prefer in many ways aspects of a parliamentary system to our system and I like the idea of having multiple parties I like the idea of having more choice so I want that to be true and when I was one of the co-founders of Justice Democrats when we launched it we had to have those difficult conversations about how exactly do we go about trying to get these ideas implemented and basically we came to the conclusion that as much as we want it to be true as much as we'd like to start a third party and have it work and take off  there is such a gigantic systemic bias against that happening that you really do have ultimately the choice of Republican or Democrat so then the idea becomes okay it's a reform movement now we have to try to reform the Democratic party and there are people on the right who can try to reform the Republican party like if you're somebody on the right and you agree more with Ron Paul and you're more libertarian you want to end the wars you want to legalize drugs I hope those people take over the Republican party and you have people who are against like corporate welfare and whatnot in that party so what we really need to do is  guess it's just the nature of our system because there's such a bias against third parties well we really need to do is harness all that energy to fix things and just try to take over the existing infrastructure because you're not going to build a counter infrastructure because there's so much name recognition it's like saying there's Democrat and there's Republican yeah technically we can start up RC Cola and see if we could get a significant market share you're not gonna do it you're not gonna do it I'm gonna work so really and again I don't want this to be the answer but just factually speaking it is the answer  that we have to try to overtake you know the corrupt elements within the system and and bring about change that way because that's the only way I think it will really work well the only way it's going to really work is if what you were talking about with voting on very specific issues because if you most of the things that our problems are not benefiting people they're benefiting the people that are in positions of power and positions where they can influence the way policy is dictated because they've contributed to  chains and because they've got this sort of revolving door thing going on with universities where mathematics professors and economic professors sort of dictate policy or or advise and then they get jobs in Banks and then you've got this whole weird thing going on with people in the government right that's right that's enough I mean that was exposed in the was that inside job Inside Job Witcher fantastic documentary for people to understand the collapse but you it's not benefiting us  us all these things that happen and all this corruption that takes place in all this influence doesn't never benefits us it's only exactly right but that's what's weird about it and if we got a chance to vote on most of these ideas instead of voting on politicians and the politicians Implement these ideas to benefit themselves and benefit the special interest groups that got them into place then things would be much better okay um you have no idea how happy I am that you just said that because Jamie it's official I sold Joe Rogan on my idea  great idea my direct democracy law it's a great idea right off right off the bat I loved it because I trust and I have no problem saying this some people will come after me for it I don't care but I trust if somebody's watching this and they're right-leaning and they have their opinions and what not I actually trust that person more on the issues than I trust Chuck Schumer Nancy Pelosi and I'm somebody I'm on the left right and I do not agree with these nominally on the left politicians these Democratic politicians because I think they're elitist and I think they're corrupt and I don't think they're looking out for our best interest but I think that somebody who disagrees  he's with me ideologically who might be watching this right now they have more common sense and they're not bought right there's no for right that's the big thing jump on there's so much more agreement than we think yeah and so if you actually give people that option where you say no no you're going to directly vote on this then I think we're going to see honestly I think over 80% of the time the more reasonable Position will win every now and then you'll get one that for whatever reason there might be misinformation or whatever and it's overwhelming and then they'll lose but right getting it right 80% of the time as a hell of a lot better than what we have right now  now which is amazing job because Congress routinely poles around 20 percent favorability this is a body that we like we could just select them and then you pull a month later hey what do you think of Congress everybody's like I hate him they're terrible how can that be it's because we all know we're voting for the lesser of two evils every time we go to the polls yeah mmm direct democracy direct my every presidential election take the three biggest issues we all vote on it along with who we finally resonate well that's just arbitrary we could say five whatever  it might be but I think that it's good to between three and five I think makes the most sense because she wants it something where everybody will pay attention to and we can talk about it a lot you know what I mean that's looks like a very realistic scent is his system of Reform that's what I'm saying what do ya think it's a good idea and I think that would really nip in the bottle a lot of corruption goes right around it yeah it goes right around and now I also think that at the same time you do have to try to do get a constitutional amendment to get money out of politics so that we kind of get to the root of the corruption but I also think that this direct democracy idea is a great idea  because you do get to go right around the corruption and you can actually kind of circumvent a lot of the problems that are brought about as a result of it what a difficult task that is still to get the money out of politics because it's so big it's such a giant part of how all the shit gets done and once a system gets entangled in like deeply rooted that's right but the system of it is actually kind of knew it has a really fascinating back story as to how this came about so there were a series of Court decisions there was one in the late 1970s  was that Buckley versus Valeo or was that Bellotti whatever there were there were like three or four Court decisions over the years starting in the late 1970s that kind of culminated with citizens united in the modern era and McCutchen in the modern era and what people do is they wrongly think like Citizens United and McCutcheon were the biggest problem but no they actually shot a dead horse because the previous court cases set the precedent of money equaling speech this is the legal Theory that's now operating around the country is that money equals speech so if you want to  if you're an outside group and you want to spend on an election hey man it's your free speech if you're a billionaire and you want to dump 550 million dollars into an election to say keep my taxes as low as possible that's free speech and you have every right to do that so that's the legal theory that we Now operate under and that has basically legalized bribery you can't like give money directly to a politician and say I want you to do X because that's called a quid pro quo that's direct bribery but all you have to do is add a little bit of nuance and don't say it directly and have it  wide and you're good so when this is the Ukraine thing Trump this is essentially exactly what you're talking about that is kind of like the Ukraine thing except with a trump was just trying to get dirt on his fart on his opponent in the election but they know it pro quo aspect of it yeah that's always been Weasley whether it's Trump saying it or whether it's other politicians saying it when they act like hey there was no quid pro quo yeah but we all know why Exxon Mobile gives millions of dollars lobbies Congress to the tune of millions of dollars because they want that four billion dollar subsidy everybody knows that doesn't have to be yes they did  clearly yes we're not idiots everybody gets that and so that's like the weaselly last resort to say no quid pro quo right please get out of here so anyway but there's an argument that really bust up this idea that money equals speech that I absolutely love and it's okay well if money equals speech then murder-for-hire would have to be legal because I'm not saying I'm not giving you money to murder somebody I'm just using my speech to say I don't have a problem with murder you're allowed to do that you should be able to get any kind of drug you want you should be able to any kind of  cute you want and the Dodge will always be I'm not paying for services no because money equals speech I'm just saying I'm just saying murders okay I'm just saying you know I want a hooker whatever it might be you know what I mean so but this is this is the logic of that ruling actually applied I see what you're saying right yeah oh money equals speech okay does it mean equal speech in these ways so it doesn't only equals it when it comes to politics that's interesting do you have aspirations of running for office someday  I don't really really is a weird word well okay I'll explain what that means I've learned to Never Say Never okay because I'm not it's just you can be wrong so maybe when I'm 42 years old I get the urge and I say you know what I want to run for office but right now your you enjoy talking about it quite a bit and you're how old are you I am 31 that's very young to be as immersed in politics as you are and as for as long as you've been yeah how long have you been doing this twenty twelve I started doing it I think late 2012 full-time yeah  it's seven fucking years man yeah it's a long time I mean old young guy yes yes that's an interesting way of putting it yeah yeah but I mean love this aspect of it Joe here's the thing in my heart of hearts I'm more like you're a comedian yes I'm more like I like hanging out with guys like you and fucking around and joking around and I don't like like if I were to ever officially jump into politics I know what it's like man I know the first thing they do is because they've already done it to me oh dig up his old tweets see what he was saying I'm not look he said that  that thing is wrong and then it's all right this whole circus I don't have the patience for that I don't give a fuck if they come after me I'll be like shut the fuck up I don't care it's older who gives a shit so you know it's just it's a whole other world as a whole other ballgame and being an outsider and being able to call a spade a spade because I got news for you they don't the system does not like people like me the system does not like people like Bernie they don't like people like Tulsi they don't like these kinds of people they don't like people like Trump  and he's the president well exactly and again this gets back to the whole populace versus elitist thing I think Trump was probably the most effective what I would call a fake populist of all time is that he was giving this image of a populist this image that he's going to fight for the Working Man and then as we already described earlier you know the status quo just kind of continued chugging along as it is look at his tax bill for most establishment pro-establishment bill of all time so he's an amazing populist but I would say it's a fake popular because his policies differ from that but you're right  they don't like people who have no filter they don't like people who really like I actually think your average American would be much better at running the government than any of these Schmucks who were there right now who are you know massively wealthy and massively corrupt as long as they didn't also become corrupt yeah but event and that's that's the important point about why you need systemic reform is that any normal person can become a part of the problem because the system will beat you down right and that's just the nature of the way it works but no I don't want to run for office but  as I like what I'm doing you enjoy just commenting on it and also you enjoy doing it on your own time you do it whenever you want to I make my own schedule don't get me wrong I mean I pump stuff out yes like crazy you do but you also don't have an Overlord no boss I can't I can't have a boss I don't have that personality that meshes with it I just don't and I'm you know it's like trying to tame a zebra you can't do it you can tame a horse you can't tame a zebra it's a good point yeah so can't tame a zebra so I don't want to do it  that some people want me to do it but it's not I don't like the idea of it well I always enjoy talking to you man and we should probably do these more often because thanks but I learn a lot of shit from you to thank yous it fills in blanks and I like I said I think you're the most reasonable

off you know also I like drinking too much you liked it a lot I can't stop I can't stop weed and yeah anything else because there's no I can't you want a drink nah I got booze right over there now my tummy so sensitive still your all mass was tell everybody would happen so no offense to hilarities which is a great comedy club we stopped there Saturday night after our show in Cleveland we went over to say hi to our friend Jessie Mae peluso who was  lying there and what was he the dude's name Andrew Andrew don't remember funny guy Yahweh so we say hi to them and they graciously the owners the club graciously asked if we were hungry we said sure we could eat they have a nice menu why not so I had the prime rib it was excellent and you had a steak with some vegetables that's right I had a bunch of vegetables on the side probably around midnight and then we get on a plane at like 6:00 in the morning we are  flying back home and I pass out and then the lady wakes me up it's like a movie lady wakes me up and I look over you like dude I'm not good I'm not good I'm not doing so much matter what happened like we we had walked through the airport cracking jokes like we always do having a great old time everything seemed normal he didn't seem sick at all he fell asleep tell everybody what happened I fall asleep I woke up like in Fight Club when you're like when you when he wakes up he's a good  on the plane like my breath caught myself and I sprinted to the bathroom and I was like soap out of it and I think the Head Rush had got me all fucked up and I sat down and I blacked out and passed out for a second and I woke up and I'm throwing up I mean I am hurling woke up throwing throwing up just roll over like I wake up I'm spitting and I kind of like holding onto the sides I can't believe what's like I can't I'm so disoriented and I walk out and I grabbed the flight attendant and I was like is there a doctor on the plane like I'm something's fucking wrong  don't feel good and right then my stomach was like burbling again and she's like oh my God you're like pale as a fucking ghost and I was like always I'm like I'm like this bitch this is what I look like ginger she goes go sit down I'll get somebody this nurse was on there this guy Garrett super nice and he asked he was and he was right in front of us like a row up and he asked us which these with Joe and he sat with me and I was hurling do I do for the first time my life I puked in those bags you know when you're like nobody poops in those fucking bags I did a watch type boot in that fucking bag like three times and he saw  it futons of undigested I was pretty sure it was food poisoning because I've had food poisoning before and then sometimes it comes on pretty quick you knocked it on the nose well that's what he thought it was too he goes he was asking me is like what did you have last night I said I had two drinks at the show and I had a couple of beers after with just imagine her friend and he was like did you take any street drugs yeah that's what he said he said he's drugged trucks you take any back alley drugs I said no man I swear to God he thought about my Niche and he ditched drunk and he ditched Drugs Forest drugs sewer shit so I  on the truth I said dude I don't take any drugs last night and he was like okay and when he told me he looked in there and he goes oh you have undigested food which means your body's rejecting it without processing it so it must be you got a bug of some kind because dude I was I'd when I talk to when I grabbed you and I go bro something's wrong like this is not eat very nerve-wracking because I was out of it yeah I'm totally asleep out and I was so confused I was like how but you were okay yeah I'm like did he have a stroke dude it was creepy I've I felt for a second in the bathroom like something medically was really really wrong if  if my instinct was oh I must be like sick or something's wrong but then when I kept like having this urge to yargh I was like something's really going on like I was assuming that it was the vegetables because a lot of times people get it from poorly handled salad yeah people get it was bad if they don't wash the leaves and everything real good people can get food poisoning from salads Apparently one of the most common ways people get food poisoning which from salad and shall yeah well dude it was just I you know and the guy was so nice he sat with me the whole time but he could tell  he's like a you doing okay and every couple of minutes I'd feel like I had to throw other quite when water can't stay down I think that's the key when you're like chugging water chugging motor he's like don't talk too fast like why he's like because and then I'm just like because of that bro fucking puking up water we're but the old red feels fine I feel fine now I would just have fuck me up bad tear and it's five hours from Cleveland so wasn't it wasn't a quick jump light for its food poisoning sketchy sucks sucks it was all had an four or five times in my life  if it's never never good that's the second time the first time I had it was in college it was the worst thing ever it was way worse this was both ends this is when your mouth and back to one remember when your past like a cartoon I had in college from movie theater popcorn wow that's that's real shit movie theaters real shit dude here's how we knew we me and this other dude we had totally different meals all day in this other friend of ours too and long story short whatever we both woke up sick the same time like in the middle of the night  and we had asked when I went to the doctor finally the next day because I was sick all day and the doctor was like would you eat I detailed and he goes oh yeah sometimes the butter can be spoiled her rotten oh actual butter yeah oh maybe that's why they use that fake ass butter hell yeah which is that fake-ass bar made out of a fucking know what the fuck is movie popcorn theater butter made out of it's not real butter because most places don't have real but Jamie's laughing at my sickness has no movie popcorn what do you think it is it's like gotta be some weird vegetable oil  well yes it was weird it was weird yeah wonderful everywhere yeah butter flavor really yes not butter what does that margin bullshit well they say bad that stuff is for you all right people used to think margins the way to go like if you Butters Parable for you have some margarine margarine is non-dairy it's me those fucking horrible for you but but all process oils you know they're finding out from those fake meat burgers that we've handled over rats they're giving them liver cancer pull up what what the study was yeah yeah  one of those is beyond meat or impossible meat or not really meet whatever the fuck it is yeah not me but looks like meat we're trying to make it look like me it's processed oils with grill marks on it why don't they do that shit shit it's mostly oils yeah it's like oils from vegetables it's very strange lot of soy and shit like that that's a like those processed vegetable oils are terrible for you yeah you know what's good for you olive oil that's a good vegetable oil avocado oil is good for you but like all  that other shit like canola on all that stuff well he can but there's my question is it because it's not naturally occurring feeding studies suggest the impossible Burger may not be safe to eat scroll down this is GMO science it says hold on a second make it a little larger rats fed Gym Rats what are you doing what's going on with you try to make it bigger and it's just going up rats something stop stop moving go back Jesus Jamie its top go back go back that's all  no no it's not thank you thank you rats fed the genetic know the fucking text there buddy rats fed the genetically modified yeast derived proteins soy whoa say that word lagging myoglobin know that Higa Higa me glow but hikmah globin that sounds like an Irishman anyway I got my Global Danny Danny mehe globe and he's a good boy the burgers key ingredient developed unexplained changes in weight gain and significant signs of  of toxicity and signs of toxicity why did I put the word significant in there wasn't in there that's felt right it did I'm a I'm an editor okay unexplained changes in weight gain and signs of toxicity and it said the impossible Burgers a plant-based Burger the key ingredient which is a protein called soy the heck my Global heck of a global slh derived from genetically modified yeast a rat feeding study commissioned by the manufacturer impossible Foods found that rats fed  SL each developed unexplained changes in weight gain as well as changes in the blood that can indicate that the onset of inflammation or kidney disease as well as possible signs of anemia holy shit yeah and possible Foods dismissed these statistically significant effects as non adverse or having no toxicological relevance that's so funny you can just dismiss things they just needed a real study in like not real well they're dismissing it because it's not convenient  right real simple I mean do you do rat studies doesn't necessarily mean it transfers to people but that stuff is okay what's the ingredients let's find out what the fuck and that's what I want to know it now because it's not the only thing that I've read I've read things by actual nutritionist they're saying look you want to be on a plant-based diet you should eat real foods you can eat healthy on a plant-based diet you can eat real vegetables and avocado and you know there's plenty of good stuff  eat coconut oils all this stuff is healthy for you but when you start making shit look like meat that's when shit gets squirrelly because you're finding all kinds of your they're adding all sorts of processed food why did you take that off screen and wont be distracting while you're talking oh no it's okay so what the fuck is in their top five ingredients calories 4-ounce serving which is pretty skimpy clocks in at 240 calories that's in the range of a beef burger depending on fat content  all the impossible contains no cholesterol to compare a regular beef patty contains about 80 milligrams scroll up Scroll up Scroll up Scroll up Scroll up fat 14 grams includes eight grams of saturated fat which generally considered less healthy than unsaturated fat that's not true it's entirely dependent upon the source and it's entirely dependent upon like how you're eating like what you're eating yeah likes the idea that saturated fat is bad for you this is all been debunked this is  to a beef burger mostly due to the coconut oil which is healthy for you fuckers this year the impossible replaced a portion of the coconut oil which is the highest in saturated fat goddamn it what's unfollow or which is way shittier for you which is an unsaturated fat goddamn this you know talking to nutritionist on this podcast has been so enlightening but so confusing when you see the way that people still want to eat low-fat you know and they like they don't understand like fats are important you're the fucking needs  they're good for your brain the good for everything Omega-3s omega-6s is that was the revolution of like I remember as a kid everything became in like the late 80s and 90s everything was lower fat but it was higher sugar content right so just like less fat less fat but they were just increasing the sugars like 1% milk that's the biggest joke when they're like put sugar in less fat yeah but they substituted it with tons of fucking sugar because it tastes terrible yet it's like shit without the fat all those monsters have put low-fat milk in their coffee who the fuck  Maria of shit to are you did stripper got tricked they got tricked by this idea that you're supposed to have low fat find out roots pull up something what is The Impossible Burger healthy is it healthy well here's because here's the thing they were pushed that article obviously was siding with the impossible because they cited three or four items and it was like soy protein coconut and something else they don't really tell you how to processes that they make those that's the thing they won't say well here's how we derive these things and fucking process I was going to say as  before I even look this up I don't think that they're even marketing as being healthier it's just an alternative yeah for me for people that really still want to eat it yeah exactly right but is it healthy for you I don't think that there's nothing there even bothering yeah it's probably less healthy for you than a fucking McDonald's cheeseburger which is barely meet anyway not me I mean right they did all the studies about Taco Bell meat and they were like fucking barely meet Taco Bell meat has they have an acceptable amount of filler that they're allowed to have and just nonsense it's some nutty number like pull out what's the  acceptable number of Taco Bell filter had a friend that worked at other fast food restaurant not going to name and their name and a marinated meat was like gee I believe it was G grade which is lower than dog food or something like that like shit still taste it okay I mean if you're hungry I'll shove it down your fucking mall I can eat it look did you see what happened at this World Series game that the other day did you see the news no they introduce Trump and the first lady and they got booed do you know this yeah sigh it's gone  he fucking two different versions of story I saw ya when and was saying that they were yelling out lock her up but then I didn't hear that I just other clipping was saying they were saying lock him up yes I'd lock him up I think it was lock him up as what they were chanting men had where they were saying people are chanting lock her up I said the other thing too is he was generally the president throws out the first pitch yeah and he didn't do that because he's already thrown one out somewhere and it's been it's very good yeah mouth let it fuck you want to talk about those we got some clips in the  of people that can't throw baseballs on the first pitch at a Patel my favorite fucking clip is Gary Dell'Abate him 50 Cent there's a few people that are fucking no I can't right now I'm good well your stomach yeah how am I don't want to fucking I don't want to fucking lose ya bad bro it's fine but I don't want to fund up I don't want to dance on the edge these are did you see what I tweeted I tweeted this morning Burr and CNN's I typed in lock her up it's just as Pop putting backlog  him up hold on Burr and Burr and and Kreischer have a podcast now called Bill and bird podcast and I made fun of them you should pull up the image for it because they fucking they have a cigar and a glass of whiskey in there icon but I go what is up with this cigar dick you guys got as your fucking image look at this thing look at that what's up with that cigar cock  that is not I go you gotta get someone to reanimate that bro that is a weird looking cigar that looks like a dick it looks like a fucking dick to why is it all rounded off at the tip it's not set the bill Bert podcast all those people whoever you're hiring and all things comedy pay them some real money they're mad at you they're mad at you you guys are things look like dicks it's fucking wave so what did it say did it say lock her out lock him up or lock her up as lock him up right lock him up with - yeah they booed the president has that  happen at a fucking baseball game know people are people are very riled up man they lay yeah well he was the other thing that I saw they had a connected thing article you know that I was reading with that the said 51% of America is pro-impeachment but I was like where does that fucking pull come from yeah who's did they ask you know didn't ask me so what the who the fuck says poles here's the problem with poles the only people that answer polls are assholes right right if they call you up and go hey Cheeto what do you what do you think about this you know this is what I think  call me yeah don't leave me the fuck alone fuck you who even can you see who conducted that pole that that nonsense they impeachment Park guards read you called because that's very relevant opinions about this impeachment if we go back to Nixon's really take pay attention to mix Administration it's arguable that Trump has been more egregious with his breaking of the Constitution so exhausted I wish there was no issues this is what I wish I wish there was no one trying to steal there was no one trying to cheat on their taxes  kill everybody was just doing their best and helping each other out yeah it's a nice small healthy vibrant communicative community of people supporting each other Fox News poll 51 percent of Voters favor impeachment and removing President Trump from office that's not good that's a fox poll when fox says that yeah that's fuck that's kind of fucked in July was 42 percent but I'm saying we're from where the I'd like need to know where those come from look at that impeach but not removed in July was 5%  aunt and now it's 4% now most people favor him being removed again again I don't know who says that sometimes there's good stuff at sporting events so the other funny thing that happened was the those girls show their tits did you see that that was hilarious these two girls are behind home plate and there will flashing their teeth they both got banned from Major League Baseball for life and she she tweeted and she was like worth it is worth it it's awesome to her she's instafamous yeah  to of to her and this other girl friend of hers I think somebody told me they're starting a smart magazine or something that was their promo for them get a nice bra sponsorship breast cancer awareness yeah somebody said they started a magazine or something though yeah okay that they got a company on the rise good for them yeah they show their tits behind home plate how many girls make a living just showing their body to like patreon Instagram is all is all dancing dancing on the line of like legal picture prostitution well  the best case of it is Twitter because Twitter they allow you you can be take it in the ass yeah on Twitter there's a lot of gals yeah that I have to be real careful if I hand my kids one of my phones they don't open up that fucking Twitter app because in the feed daddy somebody messaged you dirty dirty girl yeah this filthy take it right in the case I love the Twitter doesn't give a fuck that's my favorite part about Twitter they couldn't care less I like go for it well here's what I love about them Kyle Dunnigan when he did that that animated thing with Michael Jackson yeah actually that's not allowed amazing  Instagram pulled it down again the funniest fucking guy on Instagram yeah they pulled it off of Instagram but Twitter did not yeah shout out to 12 hardcore Twitter cool for that shit what was that would you show me the like the patreon website it's called only fans that they some of those people use not everyone but this is like showing some of the numbers that they've already been paying out million registered users 70,000 content creators paid out to creators a hundred and fifty million dollar  hours paid out to refers 3 million referrers so you Cheeto I think if you enter refer I think if I refer I get I got to pee I gotta kick you get a kick hell yeah three million dollars percent five percent commission all referrals pay-per-view messaging and tips live streaming feature that's interesting see who could have a problem with that if you if you have a if you don't have a problem people being naked I don't you don't know if you don't have a problem people taking naked pictures I don't you don't you who'd ever  I want that now seems like the best alternative to prostitution for a lot of these guys I think I think in the world of sex work I think that's the one that makes the most sense because this is a this is a legit protected legal way for them to go hey do you want to see me get naked in my house give me some fucking money and I'll do it yeah and no one should really have a problem with it right there's nothing I mean what could be I don't like what could be the debatable problem with it is like it smut people that people that think it's eroding yeah fabric of our society the Westboro Baptist Church man yeah  yeah I think Kanye West would have an issue with he doesn't like porn anymore well he doesn't like cuss words now two guys down with that no cuss words now on the album's well he's starting a new cult he is clear he's on his way it's probably going to be huge you think it's gonna be like a Scientology size thing at some point where it's going to be like people go to one place easy I mean it seems like he's doing it for free though you know I mean he's got a shit ton of money and so does his gal yeah but so I mean he likes business opportunities he does but I mean I think it probably opens up the  doors for his other businesses like his Yeezys and his clothes and all that shit that much wasn't free the show is free right yeah it's I'm saying opens up the opportunities for that stuff so so he does the show and then people like you know what do I do to be in the cult myself a pair of XI Yi zi she's got shot but he's will let you in that's all it is you buy your way in you'd get in you love that shit if you're I could get a few people and I think  use them for doll that shit so much you love it it's kind of easy to start a cult these days really kind of is well there's so many of them now like this this so many semi Cults you know there's like there's people that have followings right you know that they you know they somebody could argue this is a cult though you people could argue that you've cultivated a cult You could argue that however there's absolutely no membership rituals you do whatever the fuck you want no  calling in a cult now I'm saying these some people call it a cult like they say they'll say like hey this is Santino Nation where people do stuff like that right this is a nation right they'll use their name and they'll say nation which is woo Army this is the Santino Army Your Parts into you know Army yeah - together we're in very subtle do whatever he says very very suspect thinking like that kind of shit well just get it just gives weight people obey people's word a little bit too much without knowing  shit so they just are like it's something to hold on to so maybe if their lifes are shitty and dull and boring they hear something in there like I agree with a good amount of that and then they fucking latch onto it that's where it gets scary because then people can convince you to do anything we were talking about those guys the proud boy shit we were talking about that this weekend it's like this with you start a group The thing about groups is your now if you're saved you the leader like let's say you start the red boys yeah you're James Boyce you're the leader you're the founder and the leader of the redbones yeah  will you just let any ginger in the group there's a lot of wacky gingers out there I'd say the majority of the people and yeah when people join groups and you start this group and there are saying I'm acting as one of the red boys well you're Now sort of in some way connected to whatever the fuck they do yeah so if they decide to get radicalized and do a bunch of really fucked up things you know it go after people don't have red hair or whatever the fuck they decide to do you are now at least somehow connected to them yeah because I started the show  Des I mean that's yeah that's creepy though it is your fucking there's groups of there's too many too many but with I think like the influence online is What's creepy to me is people can you know people like member meetups meetups have got somewhat gone away but like at one point people are doing these meetups we're like kids were famous on Instagram they just love the idea of being like come meet me at this park at 12 and fucking thousands of people would go we see what Kevin how are you still just have people run with them no like meet me we're going to do it we're gonna run a 5k shut up what do you do that  but yeah that's hundreds and hundreds of tons of strangers oh yeah so stupid you never seen it why would he do if you got a video of it Kevin Hart you do it at shows like save the would show up in Milwaukee or whatever and he had a concert who's doing there he would set up like a 5K and they would all run no fuck that well he's trying to he's a positive guy and he's trying to promote positive things like health and fitness and just getting whacked you could do that without inviting people to run with you  I don't want anybody fucking run with me you don't run anyway yes I do do you have every two or three days really yeah what do you run in the neighborhood no shit I run a minimum of minimum of four but an average of like maybe five or six I don't go I Don't Go Near 8 you're a silent Runner you don't tell anybody fuck no I do everything silently Kevin Hart run it by a lake that's a beautiful Lake where is she - that's cool DC look at all those people yeah everybody seems so happy yeah they'd zero healthy running that girl the bottom right  I don't think she's running now I want to know how many people were there that didn't run that were just like we showed up my bail yeah but look at that that's a positive thing right there Nike gave him a fat check for this you think so this is all Nike fuck yeah there's a Nike Loaf and I keep this is nike.com yes this is all Nike dude oh this is some executive at Nike I'm not so excited uh-huh have we got ya forget about the fact look he's a businessman it's smart it's a smart move on top of it what I want to know I want to show you something  I saw this on the toilet this morning maybe thing look at how crazy this is this guy you could look this up this guy they pulled a cop pulled them over thought he was drunk and he blew he likes blue and he turns out he was brewing beer in his own status I heard about this I thought of you this morning I want to know if like growing alcohol in his own body it's a rare syndrome called Auto brouk auto-brewery something you have used to look it up it's fucking insane no one believed him when he said he hadn't been drinking then research has found his body was producing alcohol  guy on the right looks like his body's producing alcohol yeah right now swollen take a shot interesting man you researchers at Richmond University Medical Center in New York eventually discovered that the man was telling the truth he wasn't Downing beers or cocktails instead it was yeast in his gut that was likely converting carbohydrates in the food he ate to alcohol and other words his body was brewing beer as fuck auto-brewery syndrome auto-brewery syndrome that  at common ABS notice government got fermentation syndrome how many fucking people have them I've never heard of another lady two years three years ago whoa women claims her body bruised alcohol has DUI charge dismissed but which was she hammered that dude in the previous article was two and a half times the legal limits this was four times the legal limit she blew she blew it right but was she feeling the effects of it or is it just in her blood no it's in their blood they don't he doesn't feel it they it just I don't think you exert any  terms of being drunk I think it's just really are you guessing yeah I think that's what the article said I'm in touch with 30 people believe they have the same syndrome about 10 of them are diagnosed with it said Panola College dean of nursing Barbara Cordell who has studied the syndrome for years they can function at alcohol levels such as 0.30 0.40 when the average person becomes comatose or dying yeah these people are function part of the mystery of the syndrome is how they can have these extremely high levels and still be walking around and talking  talking well this bitch needs to talk to drunks we know a lot of people we know a lot of people could function who do you know that for Bert Kreischer Bert Kreischer probably does everything he doesn't like 50-point 0.50 imagine if you like we also had this if he had abs and he drinks like he drinks see my Instagram picture Bert today looks good he looks fucking great it looks really good with jibt yeah you know Whitney was like what Instagram filters this

fucking  fucking nobody knows me would be fucking I think they should fight it out let him fucking Slug It Out a little while I think bird wants to fucking kill him for that who'd you win who'd win that fight really fun fight to watch because early early re squirrely he's got that like he's like lanky and long and fucking he could put up a good fight Bert's got the birds got probably the first guy probably you know there may be a reach on him I don't know much taller he is our he's very tall he's tall he's what is our like 6-3 he's Jutsu background  a little bit right a little bit little bit a little bit I bought him a year he probably went he went till he got staff and that was about basically the end of his career and most people would quit you got a bad staph infections knee man it was horrible swole up like he was walking with a limp that she can kill you oh yeah he didn't even know you had he thought it was a mosquito spider bite and he just let it go for a while we were playing pool and he was walking around with a limp I'm like what's wrong with your leg and he goes I got a spider bite and you know obviously I've done Jiu-Jitsu forever  and I know that sometimes people think it's a spider bite and its staff so I see let me see he pulls his knee up I go dude and I unscrew my pool cue I go go to the emergency room right now I could you have a bad staph infection you thought I was fucking with them he's like he's serious I'm like I am dead serious this can kill you I'm not kidding his fucking knee was all swollen yeah it up like a real clear staph infection I'm like dude you got I'm I'm telling you I'm not a doctor but that is fucking staff and then he was angry and he had a really good point he's like why don't they have signs in the gym yeah like you  Jiu Jitsu and it's up to everybody to tell you what staff is because Junior dos Santos just pulled out of his fight he was supposed to fight Alexander volkov but he got nasty staff in his leg like his lower leg like his calf area yeah all swollen and red and funky because you got a staph infection the same thing like he's like why is it spurts it's like painful like you thought like maybe like you know sometimes he clashed shins or sure do it a lot but you get a cut and  I just gets infected yeah like my cousin had mercy you know Marissa is yeah it's that's the worst it's the worst that's the worst version of stats like staff turns into Mersa well it's no it's medication resistant staph right staff plus whatever the coffee but it's like the medication itself extreme version yes what staff that you find in hospitals unfortunately right because a lot of times that kind of staff is immune to medication he doesn't even know how he got it but I mean it's that stuff that can you can fuckin lose like a hand and Shadow yeah I'm Lyle one of my wife's friends got staff and she  into a fucking coma started having seizures he said she got it from a gym from a dirty gym just like lifting weights and shit sit on those machines doing like lat pull-downs shallow scratch something happened next you know she has this infection doesn't know what it is it gets systemic and next thing you know she's fucking going into shock you know anybody that freaking out which why would I use budget like the gym I go to is like immaculately clean and I still walk around like even the bathroom and fucking flip flops I'm never ever since playing High School sports you learn it's like my  dad was always like don't be fucking walk around those lockers you have cuts on your feet of shit Splat your you're bound to catch something someone asks no one's friends wife's died from it from off infection under half they were trying to go a homeopathic they were like trying to cure with like fucking parsley and herbs and shit smacking it with leaves Talan went over the house and she was bleeding from her gums oh my gosh like what the fuck is going on you got to get her to a hospital if he died they just refused to go to the doc I don't know man I don't know the whole story count told me years ago  told me when I first got staff and I was like what and I remember I was on heavy doses of antibiotics the point where like like I was Fuzzy like everything was Fuzzy like everything was like config couldn't think straight oh my God my brain was dog shit because believe it or not your gut like what's inside your gut affects your personality it affects your ability to think your energy levels and when you're on when you have staff they fucking dose you up son yeah with heavy-duty  the antibiotics and I would I couldn't believe that people fight on that sometimes they fight on antibiotics when they have staff because you're just not and you're just totally out of it leave it I could barely make a fist like how the fuck did anybody fight like this Luke rockhold beat Chris Weidman for the UFC middleweight title when he was on staff medication which is like total and talking incredible function on it I like I'm not fucking beat Chris Weidman fucking insane saying I have no idea how he did it here like a nasty staph infection he wound up actually  being a chunk of meat removed from his from a shin and it's fucked him up so bad like to this day when he fights and he only fought once with this he has to have like a rap over his entire shin and he had skin grafts and all kinds of shit is didn't didn't totally take so he has to have his like an open wound on his shin like forever so he has like this big bandage over his shin and then everything's wrapped up and then he puts like a sleeve over it like a complete part protect the skin that compressions  sleeve over his calf and shin those other so much of that shit that's in sports like orange what's it what's it called it was always run high schools are always worried about people getting from like water fountains and shit do you know what I'm talking about guys grab ya her basis a fucking died of meningitis yeah I knew a kid in high school that had managed eyes he lost a hand and a foot from meningitis from like a high school but from high school shit because you're around all these kids with all these fucking diseases and sicknesses and it's woman incubator her kid got paralyzed from getting meningitis from one of those fucking water park  well that's why usually it comes from something water happens in water a lot apparently you know you get that water gets in your ears and gets in your fucking mouth there was a comic who died from meningitis do we fuck - yeah God damn it redheaded kid really nice guy me no well that's it from New York goddamn it he was flying out to do Fantasy Island Jerry red Wilson Jerry Wilson yeah he died from meningitis he  he was apparently in the

you know how he got it from do not know he was a nice guy to men funny kid too and his career was just starting to take off this is like in the 90s that's gonna I knew I'm from New York we knew each other from the clubs and then he came out here I had been living out here for like a year or so and he came out here and he's like shit was popping  we had a development deal do a TV show he was doing the new Fantasy Island remember when they had Fantasy Island I know yeah they brought it back he was doing the new Fantasy Island and and then he and then he just refused to fuck them goddamn plane he's got on a plane and I think I think he actually flew to Hawaii to do the show and when he got out there he was fucked by the time he got there he was fucked it's always sad when you hear people that like I don't know if you had instruct you know not that he did but you know when people have to have instructions to knock it on a plane this happens all the time if people like fuck that shit and then they  die because of it it's like that dude that was in Dave Matthews Band what happened he took he had surgery you got to look it up to make sure I'm not fucking out of my butt but he making things up yeah making it up here I think we can I find to make things I remember the old days yeah you didn't have to worry about things up yeah just make it up all day drinking beer talking shit

Leroy Moore right you were more  and he got in a fucking plane after the doctors told him not to fucking fly and he did and then he died 2008 because he had some kind of weird surgery right yeah accident has a TV right punctured lung right I do that because they are fresh died from them  wow oh pneumonia but he got pneumonia or six different he died from a blood clot the coroner's office to determine his cause of death to be pneumonia  wow fuck but as I don't know if it's going to say it on there I'm almost positive that they told him not to get on a fucking plane and he did any world

checking my fucking bag yes I'll stuff it in the roof people do get a little Conti though some lady in this guy got a little country with me on the flight over because all the overhead bins were full and I was in one row and they were like four rows behind me and I went back there and I move some stuff around and put my bag up there  in the guys like you think he would use the bin that's above his head right  oh Mike don't you think I would if it was open like that so I could even look like look at all these bags and see all these bags people people are people cop attitudes for and they get mad

of the people involved and we just table and you know they just want people to come and read and write and of table report and Bautista man he look I felt like he  want to even fucking do it like half of the time regions of the Galaxy no no no the thing with Kumail the steamer thing but he was reading it and he was he was doing he had glasses on he was like doing this I mean seriously he would go

are like just really really good right it's you see it right away they're on their fucking I bet you the rock is phenomenal and table reads and table reads are important because the studio gets to see it they get the kind of right you're selling it a little bit you know what I mean the movies gonna get fucking made it doesn't matter yeah but it's just like it sells you more to all of these other sources to  feel like Yep this is the guy we want to get behind ya because I've run into a lot of great actors and actresses in the business and like you can fucking tell Dude the way that they handle things sometimes you're like oh man that's why they're good they just are like ready for it it's like a it's like a good idea the same way a good comedian can just turn on you know we can be having

to dry out as soon as the rainy season was over the grass was going to go really high because of all the nutrients and all the water and then boom because the nutrient when we have fires and then water it's a terrible combination because apparently all the carbon from the fire actually helps all these plants grow right and then it's okay overgrown and then now it's over now there's all this

like I don't know he's like you should try it so the net but for appetizers here  give us this and you know they had a platter of different things to try out that were usually sour and it's insane how sweet it tastes you what about a sweet fruit like a melon without taste well everyone has when you taste sugars it tastes different on everyone's tongue when you're on this fruit so for some people taste is dull and other people it tastes kind of like off like it's not it's not the correct flavor profile so like some people take like for me sugary stuff tasted kind of dull or like nothing Apple does doll mmm-hmm Apple's not sweet enough like a like an orange  like I said an orange slice what happened it just tastes kind of flat flat yeah flattens weird interesting I never know about that I never I've never I've never even heard about yeah every day the more you know the more you know but that stuff that's stuff I wish there was more shit like that for food when you ate it that like makes it taste better and makes different things taste better that like the that gets rid of the one part that that's nasty like I like blue cheese but then sometimes if I eat it I taste too much of

whatever president Elizabeth Warren is going to bring you into a room Shut Your Mouth She's gonna show you all the things you it's going to be Peter Budaj  Legend you know that either but it did you to do what is that some Governor from some local some local South Bend Indiana and she's like we got are he's all we got a fag running in the office Mayor Pete what'd he say some homo we got some homo running for president who said that some dude it's of local government thing city yeah it was all mad he's like and some woman left you like I'm so offended I'm so offended and it when people are like people doing a good job as mayor that's now dick yeah remember when although there was a cop that shot someone in his response was inadequate and so they  all these fucking people saying that how the fuck are you running for president while you're the mayor yeah which I don't understand either no I don't understand how the fuck you gonna have an incredibly time-consuming tax taxing job like being the mayor of a major city not major but it's a city a city there's a few people live in there you're supposed to be running that and you're also running for president it sounds like you're slacking yeah right yeah it's like if you had a job and you were the fucking CEO of whatever fucking Heineken right and then in the meantime your  out there campaigning to be the CEO of Budweiser yeah Hanukkah will pull you over hate-fuck face and talk to you for a second do you what are you doing it's up to you you're not even here you eight hours out of the fucking week you're off going doing Budweiser

are cool with it but did you find it you laugh even more look at that widely spread video a community commissioner count County Commissioner Warren Hearst can  seen giving minutes long speech against what he sees is an American changing America changing towards liberal values arguing beginning to make his jurisdiction a gun sanctuary meaning that resources would be diverted away from enforcing certain gun laws are slow in the speech Hearst lamented what we got running for president and the Democratic party saying that better candidates could be found in jail he continued we  got a queer running for president if that ain't about as ugly as you can get referring to Buddhist we gotta go we're running for prison in the game wow I did about as ugly as you can get we think would happen if you became president how bad were the homophobia be in this country through the fuck every row fucking Rowley shitted it almost would be worse for gay people in the short run yeah right yeah it's like yeah the homophobes would make they would be so adamant it would be so it'd be dangerous for Buddha could you could you could go to church but the church would set up but  it never fucking snowball's chance in hell I mean he's not even remotely close no you know who kills me is that beta or rope or work I know rakia seems like a joke like someone said look dude here's the sketch for the next 24 months you are going to pretend you're running for president and I just want you to like skateboard and say a bunch of dumb shit and you being banished envelope real clumsy with the way you talk about things but tell them you going to take their guns just say it openly say  ah fuck the Second Amendment I'm taking your guns at me beta Veda or Rourke I'm going to be Alpha oh Santino on the next time I run it's like you know how you know like you know how Ali G like he has these characters yeah Sarah Sacha Baron Cohen yeah you know he has the fucking Borat character he has the other two gay character it's almost like a character yeah like I'm like a fictional person I was like yes super  like emo sort of Sam Tripoli had a picture of Beto on his Instagram saying don't ever forget this when this guy runs for president it's him covered with letters like letters all over his body this is like vegan feminist it's like writing all over his body and I said to Silas is that really him it's like fuck it is I don't know if Sam really know ya just gotta say I'm Sam's done any research Sam and I were Sam and I have endless endless arguments like over  fucking nowhere perfect I almost hope it is him but I don't know I'm looking for that exact picture that was gonna be the only thing I do know about him before this was happening was that he was known to be in this thing called The Cult of the dead cow which is like a hacker group back in the day oh my God our first hacker groups you know like when the movie hackers Yang like that time period I think it must come from that the cult of the dead cow being covered with all the word that's right I don't know what this know it's like him in his underwear with writing all over his body  did you see that they fucking change the ABCs  yeah how'd they do that thanks now they don't know it's not you know because our youth you know you learn LMNO LMNO P so now it's not LMNO why they sing it A LMN they change the rhythm of the fucking song why did they do this because they don't want kids to say Elemental to get confused at those are not separate that they are separate letters I saw yesterday who's the they that changed it I don't know I recorded a new version of the song Right fire but it's all over the place today is the date it's getting confusing like was it is it going in schools that's the one  I don't know I everywhere though but did you did you find the baofeng picture I don't know I think I saved it to my favorites I see a bunch of like older pictures of them for back to another so if you go on Sam did you save it on Juliette Sam's Instagram it's not as Graham right or you could ask Sam to send it to you I don't I didn't have it in my favorites I probably so disturbed by it and make it a favorite you know it's Sam's wallpaper on his phone I'm sure wallpaper in this house  send a hit on his Instagram it's pretty far back okay yeah it's like six months ago yeah maybe too far back see posts every day it might not be worth it I was just going to say just Instagram Sam Tripoli Beto what a weird name to Beto Beto is so close to Beta better Oak it's just that you seem like such a silly guy and then that girl Katie he'll announce her resentment because  is just bad dude and a woman yeah throttles baby she was banging a guy and a girl yeah really well the girl she openly admitted to the guy she said was there was false rumors about their work sexual relationship that they never hooked up at work or some bullshit like that what's the problem that her husband that's probably part of it but she's married and but that her husband comma problem one that he's being emotionally abusive to her  by like releasing all this information about her cheating oh that's hilarious yeah he's being emotionally abusive magic if it was a wife doing that about mail come on maybe I wouldn't know would say that you would never say that she's being emotionally abusive about her cheating husband nope that's Larry said but it's hard to start a cold that I read said he's being emotionally abusive about her past about her whatever infidelity yeah her infidelity right then he spoke us because they got video you know there's video  of her for banging girls hooking up with these two hooking up with people and pictures and all this shit wow some common kind of funny wow tweet this morning that was like I just like the idea of a throttles kind of hard but when you saw the picture of who she hooked up with your like bomber well sometimes sometimes it's better just the imagination I found the picture Sam put update I know this is not a real picture of Beto we updated the updated I caught it before it was a state for it too damn it said no never mind okay I what I was going to think I didn't think I was going to  I find that either but imagine if it was real put the picture up yeah I want to see I want to see it regard so Tripoli yeah look at that look look look look look how nice a theist vegan naturist is that a word naturist ecologist queer slot hmm okay that's someone's boy and that's not a real picture what's a picture of someone but not fatal but of beta naught of beta but it looks exactly like it looks a lot like them I think trip we thought it was him who is hoping the old  you just say it's him yeah what does it show a picture I promise man you promised yeah I'm a citizen hasten to what and when people are Mason's everybody freaks out I'm so ignorant I don't really know what that is but I see it all the time it's an ancient group that you could belong to and I know but they still have I know that but I mean still happening today as I don't know I don't understand who's cool becomes a Mason today isn't Michael Chevelle is a Mason and I think Pat miletich is amazing as well someone else Randall Carl's how do you do  you go through it what do you do is there like a fraternal fucking oh no I think it's like some guy explained it to me once in Houston

ride only that dude how about what it says make America great again who was like fuck you we don't want it to be great  fuck you it's just a representation of the context they just associate drop so they like that's it it's also again like make it great again like what well when was it great slavery was legal when was it great and civil rights Wars are going on one was a great yeah the phrase is inherently weak things are segregated when was it great name the great time what was it great when we first came here and we stole it from people you want it's great right now bitch yeah this is good as ever been it's not gonna get better than if you pay attention to like real Trends forget about how you feel like forget about like your own personal experience  you just look at objective Trends in terms of violence crime all the statistics that we're all really terrified about right there's never been a better time no there's never been a better time for Humanity but it's always going to be United States it's pretty goddamn good we always wear our best critic you know the fucking truck just went after Chicago again he just was making fun of my city because of the crime rate saying how we can't get it under control talking about the cops yeah cago cops yeah saying that that we can't get crime under control in Chicago  well he's probably making fun of the mayor in some way oh yeah blaming it on the mayor oh yeah that's what it is it's your favorite mayor yeah I love her well just easy to make fun of she was a nice lady though we just get shot Chicago got shots taken at it all the time because it's like they're like so fucking Duvall violence is like Snot all fucking violence well that's what's even more fucked about it's a very specific area that has had extreme violence for a long time South Side in the west side yeah it's dark  but then so much meanwhile Gary that when you have a place that like it's where it's isolated you know where there's just like so much violence there and then outside of it it's really nice like what but some of the nice areas were getting even like kids would do these things they do these mob attacks where they go like a really nice area like Michigan Avenue all the tourists aren't shit and they were just like Rob someone but maybe like 15 people on one you know so they knew that a they were gonna get away with it and be how could you start it's kind of so much cake as like organized chaos and they would run into a store and  steal shit and just leave because they figure you're not going to get all of us right it's like maybe one person gets caught but Rob from the rich you know it's all video of I don't know how many times have done it right now but groups of it's happened three times in California twice here somewhere else probably 200 people get on those scooters and just take over a street and then just go wherever they can go oh shit the cops are trying to stop them but there's so many people that can't stop the helicopters were on them so they organized online yeah like Facebook  sir something like that wow like what are those things called on what are those things called when people have like flash mobs flash pops flash mob for scooters I haven't seen anything dangerous happening but I mean I'm sure it's speaking of dangerous what do you think about what Trump did when that guy when they kill the head of Isis and he said he died crying and whimpering and then he watched the whole thing on video I'm like Jesus he's like a he's like a deranged comedy writer like he's like a fucked he like he like sometimes I think he's like trying to be funny or clever  and it I just don't it's like an autistic kid he just doesn't his tick as wrong with that just does not seem very presidential know that something has take his off I think he thinks it's normal or fun or or interesting or dynamic and people are like he has no one person next to him going to we is a twitching - that's the version that you want to say because he just I we talked about that on the plane is like the theory of how do you tell someone they're wrong when things have told them that they're right how do you tell the guy that's like I want Against All Odds to be going to present when someone's like  you shouldn't treat that he's like really look at all the fucking other stuff that you know what I mean like it's hard to convince this guy that he's wrong well if anybody feel right I'm not to do things he fires yeah they're gone yeah so it's just kind of like he's a bunch of Yes Men anyway he's treating the presidency the same way he treats running Trump Tower yeah but it's the same thing if I had been tells him what to do get the fuck out of here if I had yeah I'm just doing it on a large scale but do we expect differently that's what's weird like what would you expect different out of a guy who's 70 what is he 7411 know  how old are you mid-seventies yeah it's so old to be running a giant fucking thing like the presidency loves McDonald's baby doesn't loves McDonald's I know love's Kentucky Fried Chicken what's up  some right what was it's a semi 373 did you see the photo what about yesterday oh yeah the same so I'll be worse in this is a staged photo yeah looks it does not look Photoshop fuck yeah I liked all the things aren't plugged into the Cat 5 wires they're just kind of lay them around yeah all the guys are kind of looking in different directions fucking let that what kind of IT guy let that thing be so goddamn sloppy the what is this supposed to be a photo of them watching that happen because they're trying to compare it to the one that happened either  the Obama won when they kill Bin Laden and everyone's around the worm how weird is it they all watch that's funny there's a bunch of photos go down there's a bunch of Photoshopped ones that are coming out now they're making jokes of it there's Hulk Hogan Sarah Palin's in there and we saw videos it back we saw videos we going to Hulk Hogan check and down some guy to restaurant he was on crutches and some guy must have said something fucking stupid to him and he walked up to him and he was giving him the whole like  like like like I'm a personality but I'll still bust your like that's what I like about guys like that that I like you know I'm famous and like you know it's you can be like cute and Mahalo and safer by like talk shit and I'll still fuck you up like Hulk Hogan will fuck you up he's a big fella he's a we're telling it we're saying that he lost like 3 plus inches of height because of all of his back operations because they removed all of his discs and fuse them all together so all the cushion in between his disks are all gone it's fucking nuts all the spinal columns are all smooshed  gather and bolted down and so many different places and that's all from pro wrestling match yeah so hard on you but does take such a toll on their fucking body as much as I think it's still goofball bullshit oh my God it's so hard physically so hard fish well that's why Dallas Page created DDP Yoga no I mean he really created that just to strengthen his spine and rehabilitate himself from all the injuries that he heard during pro wrestling he's the shit he's a good dude has a great dude I just think like that fucking workout is hard as shit you see like in shape dudes  trying it online and they're struggling hard yeah fucking hard man look yoga's hard and his yoga is particularly intense because he adds a lot of dynamic tension to it in right and you know that guy's

can play you can play play yeah you can he doesn't have like so some guys are good at pocketing balls right you know I mean some guys are good at moving the ball around  don't know any comedians that are really good at moving the ball around well that would that positioning you have to have a stroke like meaning can you draw the ball full table length I know right no comedians other than myself that can do that no comedians other than myself that I've actually played in real tourneys you know and I don't play that good now but when I was playing a lot I could play I was like a be player you know be level player Village it be lever player like I've run for racks in a row of nine Mall broken ran for racks in a row I've run  70 plus balls playing straight pool that's not like we're class not professional level but I'm like a legit what they would call shortstop yeah yeah and what's already is around that same level no no he's a little lower than lower than yeah but he play Dahmer are can play a little bit Adam Ferrara can play Adam really yeah he plays pretty good yeah why don't you do a poll show I should do a poll show and why not here's the thing how do you make it entertaining I mean it all just naturally will be  maybe you just talking shit playing pool having fun yeah maybe we'd have to give people wired mics and we would have to yeah I mean it could be funny it can be fun Absalon but I mean how many people can play how many people can legit I would have to bring here's one thing that I could do they'll be fun bring in prose and just get stomped that would be funnin ya to watch them do tricks on us read it on you girl Pros in have them stop me yeah and you know what's that Asian woman Richard in the Black Widow Jeanette Lee She's  fucking awesome she's very good but she's not the best no she's not stretch the imagination now she's really good but she's had some severe also severe back problems had scoliosis a bunch of back surgeries but she's you know she's way better than me yeah she's like she's legit could have Pro be able to teach a comedian well enough to compete against you and takes long time and I just was like you know that's like it's like golf it takes years it would take years like I could not play for a year like  like like you can take a person that doesn't know how to play and they could play every day for a year and I'll still crush them it just why don't you want to play golf because I'm scared it's such a specific wonderful you would love I know that's why I don't want to play it yeah you should I have a real problem with games I can't oh he would he would fucking love go like you'd be two rounds before every show you guys go anywhere but like running out of time and I would love that yeah it's Ron White is the fucking King he loves it  if we could his Instagram it's always pictures are no you know two shows tonight right now I'm playing golf do it's right up your alley the specifics the technique the it's so rich looks like exactly what you like not interested  it's one more thing on your plate that's all many things and it also takes a lot of time golf takes time you don't play 18 holes yeah shoot it takes hours now you would take it you would just start with nine is what you would do okay how many hours is that to you can do it in under two if you walk in it takes long again that cart you can you can play speed golf do you can knock out nine holes in an hour and 25 minutes really yes absolutely especially if you don't suck too all right sock that's a problem now but when you're especially learn yeah I know dude I'm obsessed right now with handguns okay yeah  Millsaps right now doing tactical ranges sadist yeah but I got to back off a little bit so I wanted to go every day yeah but why is that bad because it's fucking crazy I'm crazy I can't I can't throw gas on the fucking dry twigs and throw a match and run away I can do you do you do you do take something out when you add something in or is it just piling and piling people get in the way of my writing I get in the way of you know whatever the fuck it is yeah see I find when I play I've when I golf it's my favorite time to think  your heads clear your in nature there's nothing going on right and you trying to knock that ball and the whole point of good golfers will tell you that your head should you shouldn't be like having a million thoughts about you should be kind of fluid and in the moment a little bit so that's like the best play you can play sounds like hot yoga again I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do it hot yoga definitely takes I'm gonna do it but it's in the middle of it I want to bail I'm going to bail can't bail pussy it's not pussy it's just I don't want I don't want to sit in this hot why does it have to be hot because it's hard makes it difficult  called it's not just your will it's more it still feels annoying I don't like hot stuff I don't like hot rooms what about hot food I like spicy food what about a hot coffee I like ice better this is that old theories like would you rather be cold all the time or hot all the time I'd always rather be cold I'll be hot take hot see ya you what would you take what depends on how hot I don't want a hundred and twenty I don't want my plane it would rather live in Alaska all year round or in fucking in by the equator all year round  would you rather live in Phoenix Arizona or are or even secret great yeah it is and then the in the summertime you just find a place with a see I lived there it was it's awful in the summer it's the it's a hundred twenty is too much it gets rough but the winner is amazing yeah it's beautiful but I'd rather be in Winter a lot more than in summer a lot more like to crank a hotel room up or down because that's a big difference oh dude it went to my hotel stay at like when it goes you know like six whatever can go down below its yeah  the low as it can go so you like being called the free I wanted freezing but look at you you're like cold climate person because I run but I'm running hot white skin you run I run hot a mad who your man on top here are always drunk throwing up everywhere you'll get on the plane that's what it was I was blacked out I Bly just drinking that morning I just lied I didn't go to bed puking on a fucking plane by the way for those that know puking on a plane is is exactly as uncomfortable as you would fucking imagine it do you bring your own golf clubs on the road you  Purdue that a lot of times if I'm going to a place I know I'm going to play golf that's when it gets crazy no why yeah crazy if or or or if it's a nice and of course I just will rent their clubs from them all they have good clubs and nice course always has a good set of clubs yeah shitty courses have but I'm not playing any I'm playing nice courses if I'm gonna go and play that's a good move yeah that way you don't have to worry about it well do it FedEx does ship sticks and all this stuff they like a ship sticks it's a there's a there's places that take your clubs they shave him  in there there when you get there causton it's that's a good move awesome yeah they don't have to think about it that's a good move because like when you get on a plane that's fucking massive pain in the ass bugging the shit around us no no shipping them is way easier check things and get away tit fuck that baggage claim and hope they didn't fuck with your club but I get used to it like when I first no boards I have to bring my fucking snowboard everywhere because you don't want to ship that oh yeah I rent skis I always ask easy I don't like rental shit because it's been a but I have my own boots but I rent skis  these skis are skis yeah I guess I guess I've stopped anyway like I'm not a good skier you're not know is anybody in your family good yeah my kids are way better than me they're good yeah they're better than me my 11 year old she always wants to go to the fucking black diamonds it's awesome she's a little Daredevil and you will go with her fuck that hell yeah I love that no I go rip she does jumps and shit fucked up well yeah she's eleven sheet but at some point she'll quit 80 pounds I mean not even fly through the fuck 70 yeah she flies  flies and lands but when you go skiing do what do you stay on the easy he'll safe yeah he's carving knife things off I don't like skiing I do it because they like it you don't like it no oh God I feel so fucking good I love it this is why I go don't get hurt don't get hurt don't get hurt did you get hurt the whole times hurt don't get hurt like this fucking asshole Jesus Christ cut right in front of me because some dickwads there's always like some l a douche yeah it's just a just a little too cocky without Yang and just a little too into it and probably on Adderall just fucking with his way down this  yeah yeah it is not he's got its listener at the more I the older I get when I go do it the more scared I am because of how fast people are going now like dumb people are those stop in the middle of the trail and fix their ski I go off to the side dipshit to what two seasons ago I had I almost lost it on this poor kid I came over this hill and I you can't see on the other side and he was laying down because he had fallen and he was crying and I'm coming over this little lip and I'm panicking  middle of the air and him oh my god I think I'm going to kill him dude oh my snowboard is fucking imagine I think I'm going to slice his face open and I'm moving my weight through the air as I'm falling and I eat shit I mean I eat shit and then I throw my shit off and I grab this kid by the jacket and I like throw him a little bit probably like seven or eight you know what I mean was seven or eight oh yeah dude because I'm up yeah I kicked the shit out of their little fucking bitch would you do I put him in a fucking headlock I see fucking bitch say Santino's the best  now but I threw him onto the side I was like dude you cannot be there you're going to get you're going to get hurt like he could have gotten finally seven he doesn't know any better but I know dude but that's why I'm like don't be on this side of the hill but that's the problem is I kids go on tough runs and they don't know what they're doing yeah that is a problem you get hurt bad I mean he could have got skis and someone's gonna come in here just like no one it's not like like when you go on a blue or green no one tells you hey you're not ready for a green and let me see your certificate yeah you should have a license to do it yeah okay do it and he just  watch this lady each yet I could see it I was like oh my God she's not supposed to be here boom boom that's how you know when you go to Colorado or you go to a resort and you see a guy on the Gondola and are going up to the top lift with jeans on I'm always like I'm gonna follow this guy for he's awesome that was he's not gonna crack fucking rare possible most those guys don't have to wear jeans maybe he's like listen I'm not fucking crash let's go skiing with jeans with jean jacket jeans jeans with Jack on  over the gene yeah yeah let's do it I don't mind skiing but I don't like doing it too much it's just I know so many people that have torn their ACL broken re broke his wrist one year and the year before that he broke his ankle a must be fucking bad I think he's Reckless yeah he's Reckless a wild person he wants to do he wants to push it all the way to the lobby on drugs do with being that's yes I was just going to say that's the other problem with hills like now people are so fucked up now people also get so drunk and go skiing yeah like midday  drinking up at the top of the mountain I mean you know how much I like drinking I don't do it yeah because I'm like I'm not getting drunk and going down a fucking Hill and then what if I if what if I hurt someone and I'm drunk no I don't want to do it yeah but you see people at those mid he'll let mid Hill like that logic dude let's chugging beer no one stops you nope no one stops you from that no one stops you from taking mushrooms Reverend Aubrey takes mushrooms for skis that's crazy maybe does better I'll take my share of after we ski back at the house maybe took a  a little bit and you'll be better maybe a tiny bit I'll take a little hit I'll take I'll get i'll get a little high but like I can't get I don't want to get fucked up and feel like I'm not in control when I play pool hi I'm better I'm like one ball better yeah do you think it's a performance-enhancing drug on a percent it is huh yeah so what do you think about its way in professional sports Jutsu as well it is for jujitsu what about like compact like what about basketball and baseball and so I don't play basketball but I would imagine it's similar to pool and then it's a feel thing like feeling where the ball goes you have a certain sensitivity  it should be illegal for professional sports no no I don't think it should be illegal because it's like it doesn't make you faster or stronger I think those are the things that should make you illegal but it I think you could be just as focused without it but for certain people to enhances your focus it kind of gives you tunnel vision so that that but I mean that's why I'm saying that's the argument is they say that could be an advantage I could see that it I could see you would say it it's an advanced I feel like it I am better at Jujitsu when I'm high I really do believe that I can perform better yes I performed I feel  better I feel like a more intuitive I understand positions better understand where I'm going better you ever lift weights hi yes and you know it's funny I hate running high like a lot of people like to get high and run love it no see I get I I can lift weights high but running High I don't it's not my favorite yeah Yoga Yoga hi oh my God okay so that makes more sense it's the best you feel like every fiber of your muscles you feel things stretching you fear War where you're pushing too hard like where things are starting to pop  you feel it yeah you're bound to Russ good like the runner's high I get from running alone I just feel like it's it's own kind of like wonderful little drug right but lifting because they're because I'm such an add guy that lifting is easily distractible you know you're like there's so much to do in the gym and so many you're like what am I doing next I feel it like when I'm doing chin-ups on Omaha I just feel no yeah I know I like it I like lifting hi there just baked out of your fucking mind oh what's the one thing you won't do hi  right  oh commentate on UFC have you done it before yes and you were high and if I you finally like it I don't like it did you eat shit no I didn't but I this is my worry I've never done it really high My worry is that I wouldn't want to talk about the fights I want to talk about other things it just turned into this and we just started talking boring fight look it's first of all it would be extremely disrespectful if while these people who have dedicated months of their life and years or Life Training and preparing and here they are on the UFC and I barely paid attention  if I'm right yeah it's I'm subject to not pay attention from high I get that from hi I'm I could pay attention to the fucking lighting I'd be like how weird is it this lighting thing is above our head it's like a thousand pounds and never even thought about it yeah it could fall asleep in an accident how many people have died I'd be like how many people have died from lighting to be like Joe there's a fight going on right now I know I know but fights going on all the time PC is like thank you for the lighting tips Joe we're going right back to the fight people would be angry yeah they legitimately so it's a dick move that's that like that's that they're like certain people  will can be really baked on stage I can be a little high but I can't get too high and get on stage I don't like it like I just feel like my performance lacks it's really weird writing like the other side of it is enjoyable hi like I love creating and writing and making high but performing High not my failure words the best to be super high huh that stand up on the spot show Jeremiah Watkins show oh yeah well yes Bo let's greet was all improv at all for a complete improvisation high as a kite but that's because it's a it's almost like a  win-win for that thing is like even if you're not really coming up with like right shit that you you're still in the moment of fun although it isn't it moving from yeah and when you're there for performin Fireball you're doing a fucking Arena no can't no way that I mean we do we've gotten a little high before big yeah but I can I can't get it I can't get ripped it off I'm ripped I'm not focused I well I've gotten ripped like the most ripped I've ever gotten before podcast in the early days of pain  podcasting we were talking about this the other day and I would be in the middle of talking not knowing what the fuck I was talking about yeah and I'd like wait a minute that's all right what what am I saying what am I even saying it was so many podcasts if I look back on these cringey moments of things that I said I was like I was so high I barely knew what I was talking about right it was the number is your number accurate for how many this is yes with there were pretty close or where their numbers I got lost in the Matrix like things like podcasts on a plane that I don't think wow we're in the number group  the number was probably like 15 ish that don't have numbers and then the Phi companions didn't get numbers what's the number at what do we access 1371 you know what you talked about that we never went through with but I don't know what city we were in what we talked about doing it from one of those cool fucking buses yes that van or whatever yeah Sprinter Van Der Beek that's what they're called well we talked about Jamie and I talked about this too it was getting a sprinter van and doing it up in the inside like a podcast to here and then taking it to gigs so like save you and I did a gig  in Irvine right we'd hire a driver Jamie be in the back working the fucking the controls and dry all microphones and cameras and we're drive down to Irvine and it works so much better now that the shows not live anymore right it will be easy to do because you would just compress it all into a video file and then upload it I still think we should do that we could totally do know we should do that we should get like three or four Comics to go do like a big thing in Vegas yes and we take the drive to Vegas and make us you know like do it like a podcast from there to Vegas like a four-hour drive and  do all four five us and for hours if everything goes great sure yeah sure but even still I think it's a great drive and then you can edit and cut it down and then get the Vegas show the show and then whatever yeah and we could do it safe to we could actually have seatbelts yeah you know and I'm still have a pocket all legit but you can get those Sprinter vans man this companies that design them they do whatever you want out right I mean they can't even put a screen up like that where Jamie can like throw to a screen and we can look at stuff but we would have to have some kind of an internet connection while we're in there well don't they have those  you know those you cuz I can buy a dog shit are they yeah the DirecTV's good you can get real DirecTV in those things but your internet really slow what do you think you can buy those from like eight from the from the phone companies that the little tiny pods that you as you go can get some cellular internet connection and I think Chuck the our audio guy was telling us that we can they can combine two or three cellular signals  and up the bandwidth so maybe we could stream YouTube on a television show if you're in a place other your phone so you have separate ones yeah you would get separate ones that are dedicated and you get the correct yeah there's companies that have it set up so you can have like a backpack for like people that I call IRL streamers that walk around and stream all right switches back to us what's going on presidents that's the guy they're listening is it was no don't go to the whatever antennas working the best at the time you're there and it'll just like tell  our yeah but if you're in a place that has nothing you have nothing but if we you know drive to Vegas is pretty good most of the way I think this is easy because they because it's so true heavy traffic that if it's cell phone most of the way oh yeah oh yeah and like the 405 your head down like we had a gig in Irvine or something like that you'd be able to like a trip up north to San Francisco would be fucking awesome yeah yeah well that's a long drive rather fly yeah I guess that's true or let's take a private jet

in the  history of Hollywood and an all-around super humble curious and great guy and it was an honor and a privilege to sit down and talk to him please give it up for the Great and Powerful Brian Grazer The Joe Rogan Experience Train by day Joe Rogan podcast by night all day  Its a bright Hawaiian hey good thanks for being here man appreciate it yeah I'm psyched about it I'm psyched about having yeah I'm getting now adjusting to the sound in your ear yeah my ears and is it muffled it has it all sounded all right good perfect alright cool so we were just talking about your books and I try said let's save it let's save it for the podcast because I wanted it to sound fresh okay should we sit so tell me about you wrote two books I wrote two books and you  as you know him a you know movie writer and a movie and television producer said mildly made some fucking amazing movies wow thanks thanks Joe my pleasure yeah and in all this I think you know my whole life and whatever those stories are the movies are and the successes I kind of think anyone that's really focused can can do what I do so that was kind of the end product of the first book which  was it was called a curious mind the secret to a bigger life and that book is really about I mean how much do you want to know about it everything with everything tell me okay so basically I couldn't read it all in elementary school and it caused a lot of trouble a lot of Shame and then a lot of trauma did you have dyslexia I had dyslexia very very quite a cute dyslexia and I think  out in Woodland Hills which was the fancy part of the valley I grew up in the flats of Sherman Oaks actually is a little kid going to Riverside Drive Elementary School and then later two Nobel Junior High and then later Chatsworth High School and in elementary school I couldn't read it all and they didn't classify it as dyslexia that was just your slow your dumb you why can't you answer this and then you'd say I  can't read and then that didn't make sense it just didn't none of those things computed really that somebody couldn't actually read a word and I really couldn't read a word so when you can't read a word then you find ways to survive cope and not have the teacher look you in the eyes and say okay Brian come to the board and answer this question because you're never just going to produce more shame because you're not you don't know the answer  possible so I found that as that went on for a little while for quite a while around the fourth fifth sixth grade I really looked at people I really looked them in the eyes to learn and I found that by looking somebody in the eyes you could engage I didn't know this then but you engage their heart if you're really doing it with sincerity and interest you can engage people and move them and evangelize things Young  get people to like play on your team and or you play on their team they pick you and stuff good things happen except the Reading part but it enabled me to learn a lot just by looking at people and talking to people and my God this one Mentor this little grandmother her name is Sonja and a little Sonja she's like 410 I guess you know and she would always say to me he'd see me  once a week minimally always once a week and she say you're going all the way you're going to make it big think big be big and she had all these isms because half my mom's side of the family was Jewish my dad's side of the family is Catholic the Jewish side the grandmother was my mentor and the person that really was the single person that I could kind of count on in life and she constantly tell me how how things would go great you have a gift for gab should say and and every time she says  said you're going to go all the way I'm thinking there's like absolutely no empirical evidence I'm going all the way anywhere except my parents were always arguing let's put him back the teacher Miss Stig said let's put them back so I just wasn't going anywhere I didn't think so so that gave rise to me give rise to the fact that I thought the way I can really learn a lot as have these kind of curiosity conversations and once I graduated college I did this on a weekly  basis and have still do it to this day once a week sometimes once every two weeks but never more than once every two weeks I never I'm pretty militant to I'm extremely militant about it like how do you do it like when you mean well what I do is I think about it's often  and I know you do something possibly similar to this and and but my system would be I bombard myself with now I can read of course and I was able to start to read like in high school can you tell me how they fix that like they couldn't fix it it's not about how it wasn't fixable how to dyslexia reverses words on you right this is the way you view letters and yeah well it's great initially as a kid it scrambles the letters  then when it gets better it reverses the words and to this day I still start on the right and go to the left so it takes like really thoughtful discipline to make sure I'm always starting do you mean with the sentences or the sentences with a sentence really so you'll start at the right end of you should read Hebrew or something isn't that everything to go right Chinese or something different languages do that yeah I guess they do but incidentally  when you have dyslexia it's very hard to learn other languages so I would imagine very very hard so um but I can read and I bombard myself so how do you switch it around  like when your brain is making you read right to left yes I I started to learn just create like just like an exercise a discipline where I could like income as in college I was able to read I get forced myself to start on the left and go to the right is there a certain mechanisms that's causing you to do right to left I do they know what the cause of this is not that I know of hmm not that I know probably  something neurological certainly genetic  I mean I have no genetic Trace but it has to be a letter within your genome right to get having to guess so you learned how to read you learned how to figure it out and then you said you have these conversations at least once every two weeks so how do you do this like what do you organize them they're structured they're structured they they they see there's a Randomness to them because often you have to I have to it's not like getting on your show  where everybody wants to be in the show I say that with a compliment of course but I I'm begging people you because even though it down with you I'm begging him to sit down with me and I'm groveling and I'm calling assistance directly I still I have three assistants but I make all of my own phone calls always you know why because I have this discipline of getting to know assistance and going hey it's Brian is Richard around or and I just like I do that that's so refreshing  NG from a guy who's a successful as you are because so many times when people get that successful you insulate yourself with a bunch of other people who do all the calls for you and open all the doors for you and you just kind of stay insulated in more aloof yeah well thank you thanks well I yeah they did people do I mean look there are producers that are sort of that are you know let's say we're in the same category say milk that just do it differently I made a lot of deliberate  he says through trial and error I saw I went through the 80s where power guys had desks above the other chairs that are on the other side I'm the power guys always had black lacquer furniture they did all these power things and I thought I want to I want artists to like me relate to me and I always did everything to create a democratic environment because not that I  such a cool guy but more like you just get so much more out of a creative person by not intimidating them sure yeah and I just saw you know my peers and sometimes often you know someone maybe a decade ahead of me you know I don't know so close to say names but but just those sort of tough guys you know and I didn't think that was an effective I just didn't think it was effective and I wasn't making these really hardcore action movies I was doing movies that were  they're designed to a might ignite emotion hmm and feeling in fact even when I do public speaking I say oh they Brian Grazer dead or whatever they might say but I goes I'm I always say I'm in the feelings business not a movie producer to I'm just a I'm in the feelings business because I feel like that's what we want out of a cinematic experience for me sure the movies I'm interested in doing or TV shows  that as so because I I grew up loving those movies of the 70s and I'm captivated by things that move me emotionally and Elevate me emotionally so you make these phone calls and you arrange it conversations so you arranged basically a podcast that no one's listening to this kind of like it exactly I never thought of it in those words that is really  buddy you should probably record them eyes so I've done it for say 35 years really yeah didn't record any of them the first 15 years nothing I didn't write not really notes either and then the second ten years that was you know I'd say 15 was nothing I just did it because I felt like that could inhibit somebody or I felt like I was trying to do these sort of down low in a way like I didn't want to commodify them  you know like industrialized by conversations right and I had friends go like oh can we be part of it and I tried it once with a couple other guys during my thing and it fractionalized are my attention yeah and it it when I found the great thing about the conversations the one-on-one with no one else in the room which that's all I do again I've tried it different ways is it it create your what you're trying to do I'm trying to do is like  create the best date that Isaac Asimov favorite had or or you know or I mean I've so many people you know just Margaret Thatcher I'm trying to like I'm trying to be have no idea of time and space and I want them to have no idea of time and space and because that is like your best date yeah and I always think like what is my best date with a girl at my very for me Brian because I my best data is I'm not  I'm thinking about time and it's just becomes almost like a biochemical event it's just things are evolving yeah and I felt like I could do this with Noble many Nobel laureates with Sheldon Glascow who converted the four forces of days as nation of of nature to three and I brought his name up because well first of all I knew that your show you could you could do whatever you want and and was shelling class codes like I usually try to do an hour  hours but I hung out with this guy shut up my whole day down for six hours wow just because I was so captivated by him and he talked about multiple subjects so basically I am always got somebody that I'm really wanting to meet and it's takes a year at least or he sometimes years to organize this to get them to say yes or to be in the same city or be willing to say yes and meek fly to New York or some other place it sounds like you have  have figured out the benefit that I've experienced from having podcast and having these kind of conversations one on one conversations but you did it just for your own personal edification yeah it's it's kind of amazing but it's I I have gotten more out of talking to people like this and it's it made me grow more as a person and made me understand more about communication and how to talk to people than anything I've ever done in my whole life because you  don't normally have this completely unfiltered it's one of the reasons why I like headsets as well because it locks you in it's like you're your volume of you talking is the same level in my ears as it is in your ears we're all on this one that it's not like there's distance between us or any each other's ears and we're talking there's no phones there's nothing we're sitting across from each other how would I ever organized this I thought about that with so many different people that I've had a chance to talk to like how would I  I ever get Sean Carroll the astrophysicist says to sit down and just talk to me for three hours and to cultivate him I would never get him to do that no I would never get him to hey let's put headphones on and you just tell me about stuff like explain to me about dude no one no one would ever do that but because of this thing called the podcast because I can share it with all the other people that are listening I've had this chance to have these kind of conversations and it sounds like you've done the same thing but without an audience  exactly that's really brilliant that's a brilliant way that you figured out that this is a great way to to to expand your own understanding of people by being one-on-one with these brilliant folks yes exactly and and and maybe you do this too but I've found I mean I do meet a lot of people I reach out to me people that are you know expert that's many different things that I that I don't do of course  course but sometimes I just I've become really motivated just to meet somebody because they're so uniquely committed to something yeah they're so obsessed and I've even found that I've learned a lot from Uber drivers and Baristas and stuff for so I but I do reach out to me you know people that have really had a very intense committed to a really intense journey and  find have triumphed in jazz very contagious yeah they're kind of energy that those people exude yeah it is it's inspirational to isn't it yeah because like even the who was it Josh you might know this guy Josh wait Nick yeah okay the guy that was the subject of Searching for Bobby Fischer the Chess Master the Chess Master now is like martial arts exactly and he was able to like succeed in both templates or formats do we say his last name right  wakens said it how do you know it's wait I don't know it's wait Nick wait he's he's a student under Marcelo Garcia exactly I wanted to go this is of course you know that that's right yeah he's very proud very proud of that he should be he's amazing yeah he's he's excellent and Josh's wait yeah wait skin Oh wait can you have it right thank you very much want to get it right but brilliant brilliant guy and and he's amazing on if you ever  come on Tim Ferriss is podcast I did accident yeah excellent episode I think he's done more than one episode in fact yeah so your chance with him what were you saying no I just thought like this guy he's so committed to Excellence like it's just not and it made me like as you were just saying made me think about that as a premise like just complete commitment to Excellence yeah because I don't really think of it  it you know that you know these sort of creative puzzles that way you know creative puzzle would be like you know a movie or a TV show or a documentary and I could go on and but you're okay Jay-Z asked me because I knew Jay Z because he was very obsessed with wanting to do the soundtrack to a movie called American Gangster which I produced great movie love that movie did you attack oh great thanks  I like that one a lot too but so and I said as much you know as a as impressed as I am with Jay-Z and his level of you know Master himself I said look we've already done the entire score I mean you can't do it it's been done he said we'll look I feel a kinship to Frank Lucas who was played by Denzel Washington is a ends up being a drug dealer like the biggest heroin dealer in the in America at the time  and head of like his own Mafia that he creates and so anyway the bottom line is he feels this kinship to him he wants to do this he's very dedicated I said it's already done as much as you know Superstar you are and how great you are and he said look I will do a second album I don't have to be the primary album that's on the screen I'll do a second album and I said but I only have three weeks he goes I will do the whole thing in three weeks and he did it well and I went and saw him he  the singing he did the writing he did he engineered it he did every single thing so the guy does the king of hip-hop he goes to work and I was really blown away because he still you know how he has that grit in him and and it turned out to be like for real hip-hop lovers they really like this album I guess it was everybody loves everything he does though yeah Jay-Z put out something that was shit he does  doesn't really yeah he's kind of brilliant actually he's a yeah he doesn't he's a brilliant marketer he's when he says things that are very insightful so he wanted to do he's after that he we got to know each other and then he said hey I'm going to do I'm going to want to do a festival festival with 24:22 different artists and all different types and it's going to be a  of Park in this called we're calling it made in America would you produce it and and I said yeah and I knew that Ron Howard could get a chance of directing it and I thought it'd be really good for Rhonda be around Jay-Z that's a good thing for him it's a good he's got a good Aura and the right one for Ron and I thought well so we joined him I said what is this about you know what's the premise and he said it's about democratization of Music itself there's no record stores anymore  Amor and and the walls are down you could you know you can get you know there's a crossover between hip-hop and you know trance music and all that stuff so and I thought that was kind of cool and then I said if you're seeing this movie called because it didn't have a story that this concert they cheverus the Amadeus he goes I never seen Amadeus and I said well it's about genius and he asked about it he goes that's what the premise of this will be an immediate  Lee thought had this idea that it should be every artist every human being has a little bit of Genius in them and he made it very relatable and that became the thesis of what this documentary became and he only had that like a week before we were shooting wow so it's kind of remarkable that's pretty remarkable so you've been doing this for 35 years and you haven't recorded any of these these conversations you've had with people okay  y'all be staying  in the last 10 years I've said I've recorded some and sometimes they do face times and they allow me to like Admiral William mcraven who I really wanted to meet you know that Navy said the Navy SEAL that created SEAL Team Six and just recently sort of doesn't speak out publicly but had a point of view about the president and the whole Oval Office and stuff like that and and he's a really  I think I but I said can I face time because that was the only way so if somebody can't meet with me I now say would you Skype with me or FaceTime at the time I started there weren't that did the tool didn't exist right so you would fly to them I just lied to them it's conversation yeah that's so amazing that you've had this commitment to do this I have this cute yeah I do I feel it's a really yeah I've it's important to my life and I just it's like a hobby that you're completely  committed to doing and it's for me I'm a person that gets better I can get better all the time I'm open every minute of every day for self-improvement like if you said Brian did you think if you gave me a note about this experience or something and you said you know you probably better if you did it this way I if I could integrated or simulate it I would then do it good for you that's a beautiful attitude well II know how foul  lamb and we all yeah all of us if you're human if you think of yeah yeah it's just that's part of being us yeah so you Embrace that except to yeah yeah you have to constantly seeking self-improvement yeah they did the big part of the big problem is holding yourself prisoner to the mistakes of the past don't do that and just constantly looking to get better at anything you trying to do yeah and I think having these kind of conversations like your  talking about will make you a better more thoughtful person to yes because it gives you a level of communication with human beings that it just it's very rare in this world very rare that you get to sit down across from someone and sometimes I have these conversations with people where there's no one around like you know the back bar at The Comedy Store we sitting out with a buddy and we'll just sit there no one's around just he and I will just shoot the shit for an hour and a half two hours no one around just talking and like those those are rare  moments where you're not distracted or you could just talk about things you have ideas and someone brings something up and you consider it and then you add your own thing and they consider that and then you just go back and forth and you get a better understanding of each other yeah II agree with you I amazing that you're able to do it and get away with it yeah let me see we're both sounds like open-minded to if as long as we're kind of disrupting our comfort zone I think and and being open-minded to that your  you're then being open-minded to like the value of human error yes yes oh yeah the value of human error that's great way of putting it because it's sometimes some of the it's not exactly human error but human error for sure but you know some it's often the thing you failed at or the ugly thing that happened that sticks in your head and your makes a difference in your life makes you better fuel for improved yeah feel from here with ya the feeling that you get when you fail at things is very valuable  because even though it sucks and it feels terrible it does force you to sort of recommit and reconsider the first of all we consider the consequences for failure the feeling that you get when things don't go well which is a terrible feeling and then it also makes you aware of the commitment that's necessary to not fail to do well at things yes exactly yeah it's enlightening sure yeah because sometimes you think that's as far as as far even if you feel like you have you've accrued all the facts you've  table sometimes you don't know that there's that going back to Josh there's this extra level of Excellence that exist there there's still more room to go and you realize oh I could fill in those inches they can be filled in yeah yeah but something like what he did chess and also Jiu-Jitsu there's so many levels to it there's it's such a multi-faceted discipline there's so many different possible moves with both activities chess  and Jujitsu yeah and you just see there's the physical element as well which is a big part of it physical fitness and then also mental conditioning and your ability to stay on task even though your body is physically exhausted and then the discipline to make sure that your body is conditioned so that it doesn't get physically exhausted as quickly or as easily right yeah I mean both are that's a very intellectual discipline that people don't consider they think of physical things as being like Meathead things or grunt things but is actually  we a lot of mental stress and and strength that's involved in discipline that you you need to have in order to get your body into a position you know where it can perform like Josh's can on the mats yeah it's very very hard mentally to do that because you have to have all these battles where you want to quit you want to give up early to take a break you want to rest you don't want to you don't want to go today but you know you should you know all those things must be overcome  in order to achieve the level of Excellence that he's achieved yeah and it probably because you've done this yourself so you know what that feels like when you use that when you said you don't want to get exhausted or get yeah you that probably takes tremendous amount of focus because you get exhausted when you're nervous right because you your heart beats faster you breathe less are ba bla that's when you know in like swim in surfing or something that's when you can choke you know sure yeah  that's when you run out of air because you're so nervous and you're scrambling around and but it's the guys that are relaxed like you were like outside you have Laird Hamilton he's so trained to be able to be under the water for I don't know how long he can do it yeah he's very very accustomed to that kind of and it doesn't freak him out he goes okay there's a very good chance I'm gonna get caught in the Impact Zone I'm going to be taken under and he doesn't freak out if he freaked out it would be a problem yeah I mean that's as big as life  death yeah business is riding the biggest waves yeah yeah you got to be able to keep it together when that water Wall comes crashing down at your head yeah so I have to imagine two different thing but in you know in Jiu-Jitsu or fighting that you've done which I think you still do Jiu Jitsu correct yeah those things those factors they're just different environment you don't necessarily get nervous what did you just do that much unless you're in a competition but what you do get is exhausted it's very physically demanding yeah I bet  you get very very tired and you really should be the more conditioned you are physically like the more strength and conditioning routines you you go through the more your body is in shape the more you can perform it's sort of like racing right with a race car but you can actually add horsepower to the race car through discipline and you can add better tires and you can add a more Supple suspension through thought and activity really yeah through yoga and  wow different kinds of training it's like you know like you're involved in this thing that's a physical thing but it's also a mental thing in racing no no in what you in Jiu-Jitsu Jiu-Jitsu yeah like your body is the race car yeah right got but straight through my strength and conditioning yes you could actually a dryers Yes actually yes bigger end yeah yeah yeah I get it can do more yeah that makes so much sense yeah and through repetitive drills you actually can hone your nerves your  or neuromuscular system to the point where these grooves are cut so you know exactly how to turn and how to move when you're moving and you doing Jiu-Jitsu and everything sort of goes and flows automatically and that that requires extreme amounts of discipline yeah bet know that yeah I'm just imagining it as you say it because I don't know that much about you just so I've gone to some fight in you know some fights that the friend of mine are Emanuelle yeah okay you have see that you'll see guy yeah so he's really good  and then my daughter's obsessed with she's obsessed with martial arts yeah Jujitsu she trains hmm so what she does for a living but she trains and she loves the community of people yes she got injured pretty seriously injured and then she she didn't want to be indulgent but I said look just pay for you to start back early and you can just do one-on-ones which cause she didn't want to well how'd she end her so she got like  choked off from the back I don't know how that and it her neck yeah created a stroke in hello yeah multiple Strokes in her brain but it didn't affect any part of your intellectual capacity but it was really pretty it was very serious she so she got caught in a rear naked choke yeah that's right yes and the choke and I don't have her multiple Strokes I've never heard of that before I will let you I will email you exactly her  what happened to do but she got through it and even went back to training again she goes back to training she is my phone I'll show it to you later I think multiple Strokes I'll be like all right that's a wrap we tried that she just loves it and she now you know people are a little she does one-on-one so they don't do that move whatever that move would be again I'll get all the information and just for your own curiosity send it to but she's back in it she loves it  and she's fully recovered she's fully recovered did it have any she had a little nerve damage which and we're done honestly it's a little nerve damage that that is now in her foot so periodically her foot will become completely black and blue whoa I know if I do so but she'll get through it because she's really strong mint mentally she's  she wasn't always that way but but we've you know my wife and I've sort of helped her with tough love like you can do it you know that kind of stuff sure because she's she's a she's a therapist she's a you know she's a psycho sheet her name is Sage Grazer on The Joe Rogan show I mean I'd everyone loves her kids right sure and so that's so that's what she does she's an actual therapist with  you know like patients well I'm glad to hear that she recovered from that I've never heard of anybody having a stroke from that before that must be terrifying yeah it was so back to these conversations that you've had over these 35 years the ones that you've recorded what have you done with them you just you're holding on to them I just keep keep them people get so mad at me yes because I tell everybody they should do a podcast how mad the people get hurt me yeah right I've done because I think so many people can but you definitely should well I should because I  I like doing this so much I just I really probably like you I'm just super interested in people yes I'm curious what I'm really curious part of the title of your book yeah so in the that's so that was so curious mind I realized that jeez I've done 35 years of these at that time I might have been 30 and my kids my four kids don't really know what I'm doing you know like I'm really spending a lot of time hustling to get Edward Teller to meet me too  the year and a half two years or Daryl Gates it was the craziest meeting of all time Daryl Gates the LAPD police chief wow wow was that the craziest one okay I'll give it to you for a quick I'll give it to you okay so I really thought this guy he was you know what he's one of the most well-known and most accomplished police Chiefs and America I think there are three of them and he was one of the three in a century and  and then Daryl Gates I knew created was one of the creators of the fundamental curator of SWAT which is bringing para military tactics to the LA Police Department he started out as a bright-eyed strong-minded clean-cut guy working for the police department and because he was sharp he was the driver to the police chief which was Chief Parker  and then Chief Parker the LA there was a riot called the Watts Riot not the LA riots but the Watts Riot and the police went in and they were not qualified to be in that situation and they kind of failed at at they felt they failed at it and Daryl Gates was like by the chief side the entire time and he kind of vowed to himself I'm not going to let that happen again  and when he had the opportunity because he became later police chief and I'm not not much later became police chief of Los Angeles Police Department he instituted SWAT and other you know para military tactics and a mind discipline that was pretty you know was like creating you know like martial law people would argue and and then we went that kind of produced an environment that I think many think and my scythe  myself helped an environment that caused the LA riots because there was a lot of inequity I think human and Equity felt I know I'm getting this kind of political and you should not me with your point of view please on the LA Riot yeah well I'm I moved here after that okay I wasn't here while that was going down right it was pretty intense yeah and the LA riots were a direct response to the Rodney King trial yes exactly and yeah that was a crazy time I mean  the reaction first of all the reaction to the video the video is Arbol watching Rodney King getting beaten like that then you also heard that they had been on the high-speed Pursuit with him and that there was more to that video like that was yes and of their altercation apparently there's much more physical altercation before that video maybe if someone saw the full thing they would understand well okay you're dealing with a while person is on PCP these cops are doing everything they can to detain him yeah but there's a  east of the police in these communities in the first place because they had seen so much police brutality right so that reaction that Riot was not just because of that one correct way she yeah it was an accumulation of different events yes different interactions people would had with abusive police Boiling Pot sure yeah you know and then the whole Rampart unit and there was through is so much corruption there's a lot of shit going down yes during that time so all that just boom yeah of it exploded it  bloated and so the thing about this story is they're saying about ice but I I took I got a meeting with Daryl Gates it was ten months on the book ten months wow and ironically the day of my meeting with him was the day of the LA riots so I thought it had already happened 2,000 buildings on fire and everything and my office  gets a phone call from Daryl Gates office confirming my meeting with him I'm thinking oh my God Parker Center is under siege you know it's like the whole city is under siege he still wanted to keep the meeting at a meeting that was on the books for 10 months I thought that's really crazy so I went down I had a guy drive me and I went down and they zigzag through like a security clearance thing work no other cars could get through there was really  are you know like we see this now often but they did initiated this this kind of maze that the car would go through I get to the I get to the I'm get to the front door a couple of police Chiefs of police officers escort me in they put me in a room they Joe guys they didn't give me a cavity search but just about everything but you know took my clothes off did everything really yeah I did they think that you just asked  right little guy movies I don't know that you would go Rogue I don't know I know there's like that there's no evidence of for sure that's crazy so then I got upstairs and he is sitting so calmly he'd already ordered two tuna fish sandwiches very you know utility you know very utilitarian the sandwiches and we had the potato chips and said you want an iced tea I couldn't even swallow I couldn't eat my food because it was  I'm so shocked by the whole thing that he had so much he was impervious to everything that was going down and the city council was on his TV and on the TV out there and you know guys a police officer running and go Chief you're on TV right now and they're yelling and he goes he says to me and to them this is nothing they'll never get me out of here he had so much hubris it was it was it was amazing and I thought well and he's so calm about  about it and of course they did they did get him out so I think the next day actually because the city council was really a very liberal guys on that board people on that board rather and it's a long insane story but I had my meeting men lunch meeting how long was the meeting normal like an hour you know it was a flower so you just have lunch and just pick his brain and yeah just have lunch and ask questions you know and try to act not be nervous or upset about  and what's going on in the environment and the TV's flashing you know like archival footage that they'd shot days before you know where the day of and buildings on fire and the Korean Korean shop Market somebody getting killed and all that stuff they were showing on television and he he was just kind of a matter of fact like this is just what's going down this time we'll it's a spaz wow I know it's crazy well it sounds like someone designed for the job so I couldn't record that one yeah  ously but so so anyway I did think that my kids should know about all this stuff and and actually Charlie Rose of all people said you should write a book and so it got on my mind I mentioned to a couple people they say oh you should write a book and so that I thought okay I'll write a book because I'm going to write notes on this anyway these 35 years for my kids so that when I passed I'll have this they'll know this was a very big part of my life beyond my career but my life and so that's what the first book Is  but it synthesizes many of the important one on one conversations I had over the 30 years and then it connects those the synthesis of those stories to narrative storytelling for example in 1985 1984 I met sting you know the lead singer the police because I thought wow he'd be fascinating to meet because he was like a school teacher in England and now he's like a rock star I just thought that's kind of an interesting transition like the biggest one of the biggest  rock stars I meet him I get him to say yes wasn't horribly hard and then a year after I met with him he calls up a 1985 and he says I'm having a barbecue at my house I think some interesting people be here and that was right after the amnesty tour and he took a woman named Veronica danègre 1985 along with other Superstar she wasn't super star she was a held in prison a Chilean prison and tortured every single day of her life for 18  months and she went on the empty seat or only for a few days as evidence of somebody that can survive you know like she was hopeful you know still like most people don't survive torture either from the torture that self or they sadly they commit suicide because they're they're just so much trauma so much PTSD so it's just so she survives I made her and I say how do you survive and she tells me that while she's being she creates a story that she's living in  the entire time so there's reality and then there's an alternate reality the alternate reality is the story that she creates that she can live in that alleviate some of the pain and the unpredictable pain of torture so now that's pretty fascinating to me and I really sat with those those insights  now many things happened after that that I was able to use that like I became when I was stuck on a beautiful mind because it wasn't cinematic I thought well how can I make it cinematic and I thought Veronica denigrate she lived in an alternate reality well that's exactly involuntarily what a schizophrenic has to do they live in alternate realities so in the movie A Beautiful Mind make it really compelling we  it in an alternate reality and made it a thriller and realize oh my God there's this Epiphany and you realize that was not even reality right and and that's what blew people's minds and that's why the movie kind of worked because it was it drew you in so deeply into this character that it became like the subjective experience that every audience every audience member could feel like the pain of that in the insanity of what that must feel like that was another brilliant movie  well thank love that movie when you say make it cinematic what do you mean by that exactly  Well Ron and I realized that Ron Howard who directed it and won an Oscar and he we realize that in order to make it really interesting you have to see you have to understand the mind of a schizophrenic so therefore you have to see somebody's mind how do you see somebody's mind other than just graphically you know where you know like through graphic design and with that that's not very interesting you know  like the insertion of graphic design or voiceover narration that makes it kind of a documentary so but we thought like but if you could if you could have an entire story kind of with the military and paranoia and all that that's exactly one of the dimensions or realities of a schizophrenic mind so you get to film it with other actors and other people and that's that was that's why I mean when I say cinematic mmm so basically when you're seeing  the 25 minutes of living in this alternate reality with Ed Harris and all that stuff craziness it blows your mind as an audience and then you reflect later like wow that wasn't even real and how that guy is that guy really going to come back and you know you make it seamlessly cinematic with the rest of the narrative him trying to cope with schizophrenia itself said becomes the merging of an alternate reality and  our reality and the actual reality is when he's you watch him in that level of pain and just trying to survive you know like cope with meds and the wife and and then we found the way to make it  you know kind of work triumphantly because it was love that was the most powerful force it was that one person decided to stay with this other one person the wife Alicia stay with John Nash that's so interesting that you pulled that from that woman's experience I did surviving torture I credit her for that one always because she yeah so so that's how so I found that all of these insights you know that  referring to the ones that you have when you're you know behind just getting off stage you realize wow I could talk to my buddies or this new guy for a minute those random moments that you get to talk to somebody can often produce a story or an insight and emotional Insight that you can transport to something else you know that I found that all these conversations that I was having were like kind of like I see these stars behind you they were like stars or a constellation  ation of dots you know of and and that you just have faith that they somehow inform you and make you better and smarter and that they connect someday well it's so insightful that you look at these conversations that way because I mean I really have felt that effect on me personally over these doing this but the fact that you've like sought it out just as an education just as something that expands you because we really are our combination or an accumulation of all of our experiences  the more experiences you can have even if it doesn't feel tangible in that moment it broadens your perspective it broadens yeah well I think for you as well because you still do stand-up we were talking about that some of them might Works in my office saw you the other night and you remember who she was she goes he won't remember me and you did she used to be on kill Tony kill Tony is a great podcast that my friend Brian red Bannon Tony Hinchcliffe do and this podcast involves  uh comedians going up and doing one minute of material in front of these professional comics and the professional Comics either say hey that was great or they shit all over it or everybody makes fun of there's a band it's a bunch of chaos and it's all done in front of a live crowd and Vanessa was on it for quite a while wow okay that's good yeah she tries hard I know that I mean she was a hard business yeah but as I saying like when I watch you do stand-up because I made a point to  catch up on it  you're really really good and you telling I'm watching you tell stories that are comedic story you make them comedic and I could I think I can tell and you tell me if I'm wrong but sometimes you don't know all the answers to that story and I see that you're grabbing things that lived in that you experiences or insights that lived in the environment that you've have or had because I watched a couple of scenes  very closely and I know you didn't have it figured out and you got the bigger laugh from the thing that you pulled from someplace I thought this whole you're just a really good actor or there's a little bit of recreating that yeah when you're doing that and stand up but often times that it's a combination of all those things it's a combination of actually improvising in the moment and figuring it out in the moment and then figuring out in the moment in recreating it  again yeah and recreating it again the same way you did before but being in the moment and and being able to bring it into someone's attention as if you're recreating it or give them the feeling that it's being recreated so that they can they can experience it they can it can so when it's what stand-up is like there's Revelations that you repeat right there's a moment you and then I'm like wait what the fuck is that about but you have to be able to recreate that  yeah over yet even though like a beginner's mind I have to yeah like it's brand new fires right right and so that is how you're thinking for the people in the sense that like horse yes so if you go to see a great comic like Bill Burr right and you're sitting in the audience and bills on stage you're allowing him to think for you in a way right like he's taking you on a journey so it has he's pointing left and right and yeah we're going straight and you're just going along with it like this is the right I like I'm letting him take over the  reins of my attention and my mind yeah yeah so you know it's a there's a craft to that yeah you're the passenger he's the driver in the Formula One car yes yes and so any great comic whether it's Chris Rock or Dave Chappelle or figure it whoever it is yeah when they're on stage and they're killing you are allowing them to think for you yeah that's interesting so I love it so they're trying to take you on an organic journey of understanding whatever the fuck they're talking about yeah and explaining it to you in a way that's going to like resonate like this  how you would know they're allowing this is how you been I'm like Jolla who the fuck brought the baby and then that kind of stuff yeah moment yeah yeah it has to feel like you really realizing that somebody brought a fucking baby to a gun range or whatever it is whatever you joking around is funny right that's interesting yeah so so it is these conversations are are really kind of valuable on so many levels they yeah they're not like like sometimes people will go  people sometimes just want to get to the end you know like how do I make the money you know but it's the journey is really valuable you know door and there's a lot of people that get into podcast specifically because of that they think there's money in podcast like how do you make money and podcast yeah I've had that conversation I'm like well make a good podcast that people like yeah but then you got a simple yes we do that is to actually enjoy doing podcast right that's really the best way yeah  people like that sounds like a lot of work it does you also have to do it over a long enough period of time where people you know like one person tells another person tells one thing that I've never done with this podcast I've never advertised it in the sense that I never did anything to make it grow I know I just did it I just kept doing it I never did anything like I never took out ads I never went on shows to promote it I never did anything to promote it I just did it mmm and I did that on purpose because I wanted to never have any  thought at all about growing it I only want to think about doing the best that I can write like it just came what is that make it a commercial experience I mean it became that they came to yes but even while it's become that I haven't changed I've changed how I do it because I got better at it and because I became a different person as I've gone through my own personal Evolution but I don't change my thought on it which is just do it just enjoy it and do it and do the best I can and  I whoever I'm talking to try to connect with them you know and some people like you I'm connecting with really easily it's okay thanks great enjoy its conversation it's great it's easy okay but then some people it's like a little bit of pulling teeth yeah some people it's harder it's you're doing heavy lifting yeah but for still enjoyable yeah of it's still like when it's heavy lifting it's like okay how do I solve this yeah I totally know what you're talking about I had this female rapper at my house like really a big and I'm good  good at like creating conversation it wasn't almost impossible it was like almost record is that one freaking out oh my God I'd like to hear that one yeah yeah and then how long did it last oh finally you hit something no finally I hits to think something finally two things one thing was she liked to talk about this going to reveal who it is I ended up liking your so much she liked talk about  Inge and Basta tution okay I know that this and pinch and she's like she's got a master class on this like she's genius okay so that that she could do but it took a long time to get there mmm like really a lot of very polite to me but kind of looking around a lot mmm and then I have to go with you well we're just not knowing that we were relating to each other and then she's very Street and then when she hit it yeah I thought it was really fun  any and how she diagnosed the street that thing that wow she's like a scientist in the sheriff oh yeah well the hustlers are yeah people that are you know hustling so she was really good then then she and her husband decided they're really interested in some art that I had on the wall and that produced more interested more art and then she they wanted to know like why is this worth so much money while house house pricing work I say well dealers you go what do you mean by dealers I go what's it did so I explained what deal  is where Like Larry get Goshen kind of sets the market what does that mean and then so then I then they were very interested in that wow so then it then it got to be kind of longer and then I had to go someplace but it worked out but it worked out really well it worked out and so to your point it was really really hard to figure out this puzzle and then we act accidentally upon a way to crack that puzzle and that was really gratifying  ying and it was good enough that I'm talking about it on your show so it was memorable for sure so it elevated your people skills you had an asset to your game did yes I did yes I did and you learned about pimps and hos little bit and pricing and I don't pricing on that field you know in that field let feel like it isn't filled it's just a suppressed field yeah she was really mad about the idea of a pimp like why would anyone give a pimp money  I understand I don't get it yeah okay so yeah but she just protection right yeah I guess she wasn't acknowledging that his protection maybe every shirt yeah so so there's that and and so the other book I wrote Because this kind of ties in you'll this is kind of interesting because you asked actually so what happened is  in my house there was a new person that started working on our you know like our staff at home kind of thing and you know like you know working on the house staff kind of thing I don't have like I'm not like Butler's I'm not gonna I'm not what do you mean by house staff just like we have a we have people that you know housekeepers you know that either cook or they clean or they but it's a team of a team okay there's it to you yeah but I  to mislead you and make you think like I'm living in like you know it's not this is my picture and I'm picturing a dude with a napkin no it's no no no no no it's so crazy that's what I don't know please don't tell ya it's not that I'm glad you pointed that out and then he gives you a top hat no no yeah yeah yeah top hat and gets my tux ready every day to the Rolls-Royce rose petals at your feet yeah yeah Thurston Howell no yeah no it's not that it just is  just like an organized place so get it you're balling talk something and so she apparently should work better so that's funny so such apparently she worked at our house for like almost three months and my wife's she says to my wife I really like Brian a lot and my wife said well gee if you talk too much she said well I haven't talked to him very much but every time he speaks to me  he always looks me directly in my eyes and it makes me feel like a human being and I thought of the Simplicity of that I thought wow just by looking at somebody directly in the eyes real not looking behind them are you just looking at them it immediately is an equalizer it says we're both equal where words both species on this planet the same species on this and it makes me feel like a human being gives me dignity  mmm and then I thought that's pretty powerful I mean this is only like two years ago and then I retrofitted back all of those conversations I was alluding to like 35 years of every week a curiosity conversation and I thought well the only reason these conversations were good is I've must have been really looking at these people in the eyes and we are really dialed in otherwise they wouldn't share these private things or these insights they wouldn't share their heart with  me if they didn't feel I was present with them right and so that became kind of the thesis of this book and that's why it's just called face to face the art of human connection because then I set all of this I thought to myself we're living right now in the loneliest deck they'll only time you know in our generation it's like an epidemic of loneliness there's a it is actually that all statistics point  oils will admit that one quart of well one quarter of them will admit that they're incredibly lonely like where they can't almost cope with their loneliness what do you think that's digital lives I think it's digital lives for sure because they don't they're not even used to talking now because everything is a text and you know with kids and I have a 16 year old kid who just turned 16 they text each other when they're in the same room there's they're watching Netflix and there what texting each other like who you texting him Johnny Johnny's  there is very the couch just talk to him he's right there yeah so here is weird and this like dating you know that's why these kids they just ghost girls or ghost guys like just vaporize because they don't have feelings they don't when you don't talk to people yeah because you're really out there you're feeling when you're doing your feeling people all the time when you feel people you have empathy you feel confused feel their feelings right yeah for sure  sure and when you feel people's feelings you try not to hurt their feelings right yeah yeah when you're actually in the presence of yeah instead of digitally and when you feel people's feelings and you meet them and demystify whatever you think you heard about them you tend to like them more for the most part and you tend to love as opposed to have War you know so it it really is important in our in our lives from multiple levels like just looking at people and  going out of your way to connect yeah no I agree that's what this book is about basically and doing that reaffirms it in yourself it dubt exactly it reaffirms it myself because it right it's like a tool you're right exactly do you get it Beyond get it but it's like I learn off of it every day because I'm not perfect but I make sure that when I get into elevators I practice what I preach I put my phone away I don't go in there  elevator and just look at my phone I look at people right I'm just cool like and relax you know gel and then often you make just you make people feel better if you're actually looking at for sure yeah for sure I've the last week I put a 1 hour limit on my phone use oh wow yeah put a 1 hour limit on whether whether it's a first day every day ya apps whatever whatever I'm using and that's a good thought about using the foot like thought about looking at the phone  Lee yeah and not you know I've got this thing now that I'm doing where I just grab my phone I go no and then I put it away I just because people are really really addicted to phones are really addicted and you don't realize until you look at that screen time yeah that reading that you get at the end of the day you like five hours I'm sure I'm in that maybe for a lot of us are yeah but this that digital connection the connection to you're missing you're missing this  action to other people and it also there's a certain amount of anxiety attached to it where people are constantly checking their social media and checking checking their emails and their mentions and and going back and forth with this and that look at it this and that and it's like you're not in the real world your only living on this little tiny device this little rectangular device is weird yeah it contributes to lowliness and disconnection and unhappiness unhappiness yeah yeah  and I don't know what the solution is other than abstinence yeah other than getting putting them away well it's some point I think we're going I have this feeling that the privileged people or sent it I don't want to say it that way I think it could be the most scarce and valued commodity is being present with human beings yes and it's like you know the cool kids they do you know they are listening to vinyls right why  I think the people that are  good at it a rare the people that like what you've done you've practiced this idea of sitting down and talking to people on a regular basis looking them in the eye and having meaningful conversations that's a you've making you've made a choice you've had asserted effort to do that and that's not common and most people don't have good people skills I mean I've learned how to not interrupt people I've learned how to not talk so much I've learned how to listen  I've learned how to interact and I've also learned when people are not good at it you know some people you're talking to them and they're not even listening to you they're just waiting for their turn to talk yes there's a couple of guys I know that do that it's frustrating it's frustrating yeah well cause you kind of go what's the whole what's the point is it yeah we're not connected or not like we both like or I'm sure I'm sure you've meet people that will ask you three questions basically at the same time like Bam Bam Bam and you're trying to answer the first question then you  Eli's now we're sharp enough to know that they don't really want to know the answer yeah they're just just on Adderall firing questions about that about this the sky's blue how do I know it's blue for you I was just I just had lunch with one of my funniest close friends his name is Jimmy Iovine and he's a music producer music producer and he and Dre created this beats and we have known each other like I guess 30 years we were at this restaurant called when he would say it's Greek restaurant Beverly  and our waiter Jimmy goes out dudes on a tour because he was like I mean like he just I said it's too much Tony Robbins from he said now it's Adderall yeah but he was just like you couldn't finish this ends or we said okay we think we know we want we're going to have the Branzino he rattled off like ten dishes we go we realized we couldn't stop them hmm we knew what we said what we wanted right he don't want to hear  here he wanted to do the other nine yeah so that's a common thing today incredibly common there's a lot of people in speed a lot and the doctors are just over we actually in speed that's what Adderall is yeah so you think people are really that's the thing I don't know that much about the legal speed Adderall is legal speed prescribed by a doctor if you went to a doctor right now you went to the right doc yes and said I just feel listless I'm having a hard time connecting I'm having a hard time getting  motivated oh I got the thing for your barn wow you go and you'd be like I am organized and you know what is about me it's about your fucking kicking ass and other people that are slacking they're all losers this guy's a loser that guy's a loser that is deadly really fit Larry it is not that wrong mindset that is Harold mindset around - it's basically a low level math mindset yeah beat it super jacked up  listening just talking and so much like assaultive yeah well you can get productive you can get a lot done with that but you know it's just there's a lack of connection yeah there he is empathy yeah it's not really real well yeah it's a weird sort of vibe that going to look for it and I'm going to prospect for it was you'll find its mining for gold today I didn't realize there's gold in them thar Hills you go prospecting for people that have a better at all you better have  large cargo to put it in large train box I gotta check it out because I thought was funny when he said it and I thought he goes no no I'm this is really true like what you would say to me right now because no no this guy he's actually on it and I go yeah really and he says yeah how does a guy become that guy he literally was on that table a lot of writers lot of journalists yes a lot of journalists a lot of people that have two deadlines and have to push and they run out of energy a lot of them are  on Adderall so extremely extremely common extremely common with very productive people very ambitious people business people people that do a lot of meetings people that work 12 hours a day 13 hours a day it's it gives you the energy to do that and then they take Ambien to crash and there's a double whammy going we know that's not good no no no no no no yeah it's yeah it's there's millions and millions of people that are on that stuff did they ever if you ever ask somebody on the show like  I went well I don't did anyone ever tell you their honest yes don't really tell me yeah like a comedy clubs or on the show no I've had people tell me on the show they take out a roll I've had people in real life tell me they've taken out our all mean I've had people Justified I've had people talk about it with a little bit of shame that they like to not be on it but they're on it because it helps them be productive and they got to do what they got to do yeah but but the real Revelation was I have a friend who's a journalist he was talking to me about how many journalists  it's are on and he's not on it I go how many he goes Fucking all of them I'm like are you serious legal Duty would have blow your mind it would blow your mind how many of us because it's so effectively we wouldn't I wouldn't let you know I've never messed with it yeah but if you do Jimmy you've tried it right how was it did not like it I had to call off the next day at work because I thought I could go to sleep with your perfect a little bit yeah just to do some artwork because I know I'm going to have to do you have an unusual Constitution like Jamie biggest  marijuana does not affect him whoo like literally he can take a thousand milligrams of play video games or buggies or more okay thousand milligrams put most people under the couch for life to be like no mining wow Jamie can handle it I cannot do that I can't do it you know there was a minute I was single

yeah I like margaritas I do to this he got all your stuff careful with these snacks no I'm not going to touch it okay this is what's that one this is a real issue can you do it during the day if you want to die some spray ya know you can yeah of course I mean can you do it during the day be functional highly functional yes I can yes  yeah I really admire well yes it worked me more than have me it works with my are so high functioning yeah but it just makes me more sensitive that's what marijuana does to me but the paranoia I kind of just embrace it you know the paranoia that comes with being really really high wow I just meditate calm down embrace it and enjoy a wave yeah yeah a lot of the freaking out comes from freaking out yes I know absolutely me you like you frickin  now tell me like oh my God I'm freaking out yeah I'm watching myself I'm going oh I'm out of control and think I'll freak out and then that's what happened sounds crazy but it makes me a nicer person wow yeah makes me nicer I want to be better I want to be a better person because I've laid in it highlights all the flaws that I find in my own personality and my own life well all the whatever things I've done that I'm not proud of or that I think our mistakes highlights them and it makes me think you know more diligent  he'll be a better person jeez it's good hands is my sense of community makes you more sensitive me getting in contact her high right now well this is sober October feeling so I'm not doing anything can you do that I guess you can't yeah I'm not even an addiction but me and my buddy we should dig it yes fun when you and your buddies are cool with it yeah we do sober October so okay the entire month of October every year we do something like last year we did a fitness challenge that think it's like Ramadan yeah it's like Ramen  not for us and the year before that we did Hot Yoga we had to 15 Hot Yoga sessions over the month she is yeah this year we have to do 10 classes of any kind and we have to read 500 pages of any book yeah so we do it like to test yourselves yeah but just is it and it's fun and cool will join along and this year we're all wearing these whoop straps so what is it Loop strap Loop strap is it's a fitness monitor that's it works with this application that works on your phone that it monitors heart  variability so it tells you how first of all tells you how much you're sleeping which is very revealing yeah tells you what kind of sleep you're getting it it gives you like very detailed analytics shows it how much do you sleep can we just stay in that one cuz imma sleep apnea so I know because I go to an app I have an M okay so do you use a CPAP machine I do yeah I do I you guys in a row use a CPAP my friend Chris Ryan who's here right before you use a CPAP machine is my thing like this yeah I have sleep apnea as well I got 87 lat I had a bad day  seven that's the score that's the computation that's like a coefficient how many okay I don't wear glasses but you can see it yeah it says 87 but like what does that mean like how many hours okay five hours and fifty two I think 30 set was at 5:52 yes usage hours it says five hours and fifty two it says good yeah okay in the seal get good to seal it so you had six many interruptions event six events per hour it says oh that's not good well it  probably right I had a bad I didn't sleep this is 0.6 is that the same thing as 6 know what does that mean oh so you didn't have six an hour yeah 16 hours a lot well it's just weird because it says 0.6 and it says 5 in the corner what does that mean five total over the five hours of sleep look sound what are you you wizard well he's thinking he's measures pot he can do it he's like a pound of pot not a problem it says mask on and off for so you took your mask off for time to P2P  twice and then twice because I was obsessing over something you know I had to break the obsession I understand yeah okay I wear a mouth piece dude those are asses down on my tongue yes he's my tongue from falling back over oh hole in my mouth oh so it's not about your teeth it's about falling back yes yeah what is that thing called what's that called when that happened who doesn't matter what it's called but you have dr. Kevorkian that is named Caribbean no I'm working a murder  yeah he's the man he's roping yagnik rope obviously whoops mistake but yeah it just keeps your tongue from falling back I have a fat tongue that's my problem fat fat wow closes the air hole geez yeah so it keeps it from doing that a lot to be said about yeah I guess yeah so yeah okay so with the loop strap does is it monitors all-mountain probably meant but it also measures  heart rate variability so it tells you whether you're tired or not so if you've had a hard workout and then you're still a little beat down the next day it'll show you on the application like you'll be here's your heart rate your heart rate is responding to the fact you got extremely stressful physically stressful day so good stresses and bad stress is exercise and lack of sleep all those things are monitored and it gives you like pretty detailed analytics so we're all wearing these straps and we're doing these 10 different classes like we've done tactical gun classes and yoga  this is in boxing classes and the whole idea about the month is sort of just helping yourself like doing doing things that are good for you self-help great got it I yeah like yeah self-help yeah like this is the month of getting smarter better getting learning some new shit you know meditating getting getting an education reading you know 500 for the guys you have some seguro stand-up comedian Bert Kreischer another comedian  and Ari shaffir and myself and we've done this for the last well the first year Tom and Bert had a weight loss challenge and then the second year we said okay we'll all jump in will all be sober this time because they weren't sober the first time like they just lost weight and we'll all be sober and while have you look to fulfill these number of hot yoga classes with 15 90-minute hot yoga classes and then the next year we have teen 90 minutes yeah wow and then the next year we had a crazy  fitness challenge that got a little out of hand so we decided not compete with each other anymore because we were literally going five six seven hours a day of working out yeah seven hours a day of cardio it was banana suit that's it was nuts yeah I was getting high on exercise and so then this year in your group I know think I know why now this year it was just just just a fitness classes different classes 10 classes and then 500 pages of any book just reading something pretty great that's  fun yeah it's gives me something to do to like we look forward to it and then a lot of fans do it along with us so a lot of people go sober through the month and joining with us and you know fans from the show Say Hey I want to be part of this now they just jump in I mean you wear whoop strap to you can compare the amount of sleep in the amount of exercise that you get to us but more importantly for people it's nice for people that maybe don't even know that they have a little bit of an issue with substances I mean maybe they're not alcoholics or drug addicts but maybe they just surrender  drink a little too much and so they'll get this break for October because they're committed for the entire month and then what they see is like you know what I feel a lot better and you know I don't have a problem but I do feel a lot better when I'm not drinking all the time because I'm going to comedy clubs you know have a couple beers hey you want to do a shot all right let's do a shot and then the next day I'm like oh then I go to the gym and it's like a little bit more of a struggle but this entire month you know what does it say of 23rd this there's none of that it's entire month is  just you feel drunk yeah and you realize like that is an unnecessary tax right in your system alcohol in particular you know pot doesn't make me feel like shit the next day but it definitely does some wonky things to your memory pot the first roar oh yeah for sure we all have pot memory all the hot pot memories weird yeah it's definitely definitely does something to remember I mean that's pretty much proven okay  now we do on the most interesting yeah so the these go and you guys can afford to do that because you can still work yeah so the stand-up still do you do podcast still do everything yeah and then we have no remember November where we get blitzed okay that is hilarious there's nothing to look forward to right I really didn't I didn't really I definitely went Blitz you just go for it yeah when hard couple of days in November last hole and nothing super funny and your buddies are funny  uh yeah they can be fun keep each other yeah well it's a camaraderie thing to yeah the four of us it's a lot of bonding and it's very fun like the podcast we have a very fun and the one that we did when sober October was over last year was ridiculous we were we're barbecued it was very fun yeah but it's it is a good thing for people just to have that monthly that one month reset of their system yeah just to give them a perspective like hey you know maybe it'd be better if you didn't  I think you know maybe better if you took some time off may be better if you exercised and and really thought about things this way I mean we're only doing it once a month but we even propose doing it a couple times a year and appropriate approves to I guess obviously it's which it does prove to you you can do it yes and that's important yeah think it's like having an exit right yeah you know when you were trapped on a boat or you're someplace with be what you have an exit here you know you can do it well the motivation for a lot of it was our friend Bert  who drinks way too much and he's calmed down quite a bit apparently because of doing that first podcast where we did go sober for the whole month because we were we didn't think you could do it because even during the weight loss challenge Tom who won the weight loss challenge Tom didn't drink anything but water the entire month and worked out like crazy and lost a ton of weight Burt kept drinking the entire month and also worked out like crazy and tried to lose weight and what happened he lost oh can't compete with Todd doesn't work yeah but what's just it was a  dumb way of doing it you know wasn't wasn't as effective right yeah of course do you now there's this new I guess nutritional exercise or weight loss I don't want to only call it that of like what is it 60 knives I don't know is it 10 hours on ten hours off so in a sense that things intermittent fasting yeah  basically see I can't lose weight I mean I'm a happy I don't need to lose weight actually but I could get stronger and behave better you know disciplines and areas so but that particular thing is about losing weight I think right mostly it's about losing weight but it's also about feeling better and raising your Ketone levels which is one thing that does happen when you go long periods of time and you get your body accustomed to this period of time  you're not eating you know this time deeding or whatever they call it what it was it the term they refer to it as it's not just intermittent fasting there's time restricted eating yeah okay there's there's some benefit on your digestive system as well you know so your body's not eating you know 10 hours a day 15 hours a day or you know even more with some people some people just eating constantly throughout the day instead of this you have a four hour  ER window or a six-hour window or an eight-hour window whatever you decide it is and during that time you can eat but after that it's over and then you cannot eat for x amount of hours whether it's 10 or 12 or 14 yeah you get accustomed to it though yes he my goal because I don't know if I could I'm sure you could prove me wrong but I'm not sure I could do any of those really strict disciplines of any type almost so I've always thought if I do everything  moderation I might not have to do one of these things that I might find to be to start district is not hard it's not hard it's not know you games are you it does seem hard so you really hard yeah yeah get used to it though you honestly get used to it and then once you do get used to it then it becomes normal okay yeah I and there's a once you get like a couple three days four days or a week or something yeah once you get a few  Days Inn it's no big deal yeah it used to is that a way of saying that if I really committed to it it's possible I could do it of course all right okay look you're an accomplished man you can do anything you want you just have to force yourself to do it for us we just decide like they need a compelling reason right do it sure well that's one of the doctor said right yeah that doctor that sleeps over your house and write a prescription but like the thing that we talked about like sober October one of the things about it is that we all know that this is coming  yeah October 1st boom it's here yeah so you're committed for the month it's not like a wishy-washy idea nervous about it no is there any anticipated anticipatory yeah you stressed about no not really but you think about it you think done it a couple years in a row now three years in a row but the thing about it is that it's there it's a real thing it starts and then you don't you can't be wishy-washy like part of the thing that has people have a problem with diets and with exercise routines is that their wishy-washy they give themselves a way out if you know  know that you have to work out one hour six days a week yeah every day you have to work out one hour you get one day a week off your good shit yeah no cheating yeah and you write it down on schedule and you decide all the month of November I'm going to work out one hour a day six days a week period and then I'm going to write it down I'm going to mark my calendar with an axe every time I accomplished that well if you just do that you're going to get it done but if you say oh I need to work out more well that's not a very specific goal a little flexible yeah yeah it doesn't specifically yeah  you have to go there's no this is this is absolute yeah these boundaries are inflexible you have to hold yourself accountable okay yeah you have to make sure that you're accountable all right what I pick some up like that I'm going to let you know would you would you want to do like if you wanted to do something if you had a thing and you say hmm what I want to do  maybe I'm not not drinking for a month I've never that I haven't done that how about no booze November  but that's coming up maybe for next year you mean I need to warm up here I gotta warm up how much time you need to prepare a year sounds good so bright over why don't you do sober October with us next year wow how about that gives you a hole in my mind I got it I'm not sure well I'm going to try to to try to think about doing it yeah you don't have to do it yeah but I can I can try to warm up and think it's possible certainly could do it yeah you should probably could do it I mean  took a week off and then it was a very kind of gone I could have done no I could have gone well it well yes a little bit it was a little bit but I thought after the week I thought I could keep going but that I don't know it's kind of nice luxury to have a margarita glass and what is a nice luxury so I thought I don't know I no one's making me not I'll just go back to drinking right yeah that's the thing I mean I have no reason you don't like it but if I had reasons and  I'd like I didn't want to wear that sleep apnea machine and I put it off for five six years really yeah and then by the way these sleep apnea machines got smaller and smaller and smaller and less intrusive so now they're very easy yeah but it still was somewhat intrusive and now I it's I always sleep with it I never thought I would do that because I thought you know I'm leaving my wife I like to feel like I'm romantic  or something I could be inside Darth Vader no rude that's what it sounds like yeah start saying it does I don't know how I don't know how she perceives it yeah I will be honest he wants me on it she calls it the tube of life but you have the to belie fun oh that's a good way to live like sugar yeah so thank god well yeah it really does I mean he's sleeping right next to me I'm glad she wants me to live it's probably want you snore either yeah I don't  it's nor I never snored really yeah the sleep apnea that I had wasn't a snoring it was more like like that oh King Kong yeah the choking kind of thing where you dumped you you stop breathing right so it's not snoring got it yeah yeah it's scary stuff a lot of people have it well yeah it's a terrible for your health yeah that lack horrible to your health and you lose oxygen to your brain and all these different things that and so many were to leave leave that alone because  do do it I don't want to jinx myself out here I'm very superstitious so I really very very very so if I doing something right I don't want to I don't want to brag about it I don't want to do it because I then I'll think I just you fucked it I don't yeah I don't want to fuck with things like there's with an equilibrium has been found whatever that thing is hmm I just quiet down on it so you find something that works you find a good vibe yeah but I don't dick with it I don't brag about  bad I don't say anything because then I think well maybe someone that battle I you know right so I once was fat actually really GF chub like you know roles like the guys that have rolls of fat in the thing and I was with a girl who you know a very very serious young and everything and we went to her Beach her Beach was caught a little Doom you know Doom Beach little doom and she's talks to these she goes I have to go talk to these guys and they were the cool Surfer Dudes  and it was like 25 years ago 30 years ago and she's talked see these guys and they start laughing and I go what are you like what are you guys laughing at to her because she's now left these and they're back there and I see it A Chorus of them kind of laughing they go well I guess they're laughing because they said we never thought you'd be with like a fat guy and I thought wow they look at me and that's what they're that's what they're seeing and they think it's funny I gotta fix this and I that was like the  straight up October forever for me that is what's called fat shaming fat shaming yeah I don't even know that there's something amazing yeah you know you never heard of fat shaming never heard it well that's it's a very controversial thought because some people think that fat shaming is terrible and that you shouldn't do it to people and what other people say that fact it's true it does work on certain people but it makes people feel bad and some people think you should protect people  I'm feeling bad whereas other people think you should tell them that they're fat so they feel bad so they act on it how do you see it I'm Joe Rogan call it I'm the ladder I think you should tell people that they're fat if they want to know God you said I don't think you should go out for people and you can feel like they want to know you mean like they want to know I don't think you should protect what's a what's a okay give me the signal of if you want to know like your with some friend to you all right let's say you're with someone you only know a little bit  I wouldn't say anything then okay so now you're with a so we're talking about like relatives or know you're talking about a husband wife or yeah boyfriend girlfriend that's tough because they can resent you forever yeah you got to be real careful especially the ladies yeah yeah and if you're a man and you resent your wife forever because she told you're fat you're probably not really a man  that's really funny you might be a little bitch oh my God I can't believe you said that really I mean I like it because it's I don't know what you like you might be a little bitch might be a little bitch yeah if your wife says you're fat and like if my wife tells me I'm fat I'm like I'm not fat yeah we talking about doesn't work you only works if you're fat it's one thing if they're saying some yeah yeah there is one thing if they're saying something about something you can't control like  I wish you were black I don't like white okay I have a question terrible sin sounds like you have no boundaries on your show right okay the guys that have really little dicks whoo that's a rope that's rough one I even I got it I am hearing you so do you think the girl the what let's do you think and the girl the girl the guy are together did the girl ever say you have a little do they ever does it I'm sure someday they say it but here's the thing some girls we feel pretty  like rough guys we can talk about I think there's some girls who are some girls who are beautiful beautiful girls yeah are also lesbians oh yes writer yeah so some girls popular to be some girls who are beautiful girls are bisexual so they like girls and guys here's the question with those girls the more likely to settle for a guy with a little dick yes or a rich guy with is it they like girls to be girls and like God  is no matter what to have a big dick all right the way that's I think they like probably the latter that's it Robin away unfortunately Evolutions a motherfucker really is yeah I think that that's you know there's not a damn thing a person can do about that one you know you could suck fat out of your way stu stuff in your ass you can get fake boobs there's a lot of things you do if you got a little dick that's a wrap son she can do I mean it's probably just some  operations that can help you out a little bit I think that plan for the most part yes yeah cutting and Dick they usually don't go to makes guys crazy when they have sure I think it's guaranteed you must you must make them suicidal it because it's when I wanna see started throwing shit right now that would mean like we had looked maybe and have had a crazy I think I think there's certain things that you know there's nothing you can do about it you just have to handle that roll the dice whatever you got  yeah I would guess yeah that's one of them but I mean if if things like crisper and genetic manipulation and things they're working on now yeah that's probably one of the first things they're going to work on that's fine I actually never thought of yeah yeah right on the show today I think of in yourself or okay I'm gonna be honest with you but I don't think there's anything more profitable except yeah UT Beauty would be incredibly profitable for people who but not both fall that  same depart well somewhat gym area yeah beam like cousin whatever it is Cosmetics I guess yeah yeah yeah not just Cosmetics but even you know people that are not one guy with a little dick cream not operational no going on operational mean maybe one day they'll be able to do something yeah the shoot a little virus in your body and also interpret our let me something I can happen yeah I mean it's not insurmountable  scientifically yeah there's so many things that there are there are already doing with genetic manipulation yeah it's not outside the realm of that outside the realm it seems possible let's start calling our scientist right now call them up and see what's a say yeah so anyway that you learned about fat shaming I got that that's can't believe you didn't know about that that's like in the Zeitgeist right now is it yeah people I miss the people for fat shaming Yeah Mmm Yeah James Corden got mad at Bill Maher Delmar was mocking fat-shaming who think maybe  should be shaming people more to him directly no no oh just Bill Maher was talking about on a television show that maybe we should be shaming people oh I see I see and then James Corden said I have a problem with that and you know he's talking been beta bunch of Fat Jokes which I found were kind of kind of weird I'm making fat jokes while you're being upset at someone's calling you fat is the yeah he thought he could get that one by you we did that one didn't give my nobody in the all  so does have a comedy talk show so it makes sense that he was making jokes Yen comedic in his but it does because he doesn't like I got sucked it's it's it's not something that you can't fix and that's one of the things that people have a problem with being sympathetic about it and that was Bill Maher statements bills and obviously very slim man yeah but it's not something you can't fix it's a problem to fix it's hard to fix hard probably requires discipline and also  your gut biome is probably all screwed up from eating bad foods and you know you probably are accustomed to certain certain Behavior patterns that are unhealthy for you yeah because the times you're eating the kind of foods you're eating yeah all that and fix I fix mine with but I mean I wasn't fat in the that really you fix it was shame I fixed it was shape she shamed me I start jumping rope and I started with I do all everything  with an achievable goal I just did a couple minutes and I just kept going and then pretty soon you know I did the rope with the that had a counter on it those plastic beads that gives a little weight on them and a nylon rope and nylon cord and you could really wet get it going yeah I could do 200 beats a minute for 30 minutes and you're holding your body very tight so it actually I didn't think of it that way but it really strengthens strengthen my core yeah jumping rope is  amazing yeah so you obviously do yeah it's great you didn't only to warm up or mostly yeah I just do what kind of get going yeah yeah yeah but boxers that's why the boxers use it so much I

there's a lot of videos online where people are doing like these YouTube workouts of jumping rope and then they also have waited ropes which is makes it more I used a weighted rope to yeah I used to go everywhere with the these  up so far in an airport I'd be doing it I remember being on a Tarmac in Greece in Athens waiting and I was doing it I would do it on in the rain I would all always every day I did it that I did with no fear without fail for almost 12 years wow deal trainer personal trainer I do now I didn't then but I do now is because I think what helps me so much also  sure it helps me get into the gym without fail because I don't want to him have him wait Derek by the way Derek I shouted to Derek because I said something about I'm doing Joe Rogan and he goes oh I listen to them all the time I go give me some inside really start collecting stuff he had fact I could even show you he wrote notes I didn't read them because I didn't feel like I had to but literally I'm sorry but

off the show you know tomorrow you're gonna get back to go back to normal I like it I'm gonna feel that yeah it's not it's not an issue okay so what is Derek what kind of advice to give you on the show yeah  it said I don't look at it but when he gave me some advice he said you know he told me your background first of all I didn't realize the chronology of your background I didn't know he knew Gino's New Jersey right he just knew all the stuff oh so he didn't sure zika pedia well I think you do know he did more than Wikipedia no no I know that sounds what yes that leads you to Wikipedia But I pop that on them so it wasn't like  that was today so he didn't like go let me just tell you about it he didn't do but start looking at a smartphone he knows your show really well he's a him he's a guy's guy you know and he's a pro he's a straight talker guy he's a real yeah he's a broke his will no wonder this is bro that that expression is weird because it used to be like first of all black dudes owned it yeah what up bro it was like that and then it became White  eyes like dorky white guys okay here we go I'm gonna give it to you right as you seem interested in everything okay I like I like the Rogan podcast because it's casual conversation so I should he always he always sets the guess titties and weaves to topic seamlessly I'd leave it alone that okay but he says everything is awesome I mean your son's broke your solo you said I just like how you would be perfect what kind of stuff is Derek having you do oh  Ali physically well okay so I get in there I do an elliptical you know for me I do it as high as hard as you could possibly do it for 20 minutes so it gets everything kind of going and for my rotary cuff so it Lubes that up a little bit and I have some injuries there were dying thing about it the rotator cuff by doctor  you know him an eel elat wragge okay he's away he does have teams and stuff like that when you say I don't need surgery eventually I will have to eventually I might have to have surgery he says I'm a surgeon that's what I do but I don't want you to have surgery you don't need it you're going to have the same strength you would have and it just will hurt a little bit and and this is a rotator cuff tear it's a rootkit rotator  laughter have you ever had stem cells no is that a good idea oh tell me how definitely okay oh wow I'm getting this from the man right on public I'll talk to you after it's over and I'll give you like places I would go and talk to I have a full-length rotator cuff tear and it's gone from stem cells is there any thing and nothing negative not for me and I I know of ago negative repercussion that's fantastic I love knowing that you know certainly can help you okay  all right matter of fact the place where I go is the world of place I go is in Santa Monica and I've been hearing their I've been going there for years what's the name of the place lifespan medicine oh it's not Marc Forster no no life spend okay I don't know you'll explained life everything I would love that thank you so much okay but there's a lot of different treatments that they can do now that for soft tissue tears things like rotator cuffs and muscle tears things along those lines they can it's amazing what they can  do now wow okay that'd be awesome so what does he have me do I do you know variety of different have to wait you know multiple you know curls he mixes it up so it's sort of cross training so I'll do dumb things cool I'll use those little slides that I love put on your feet and you there's four different things you can do you open them you do the push-ups you'd and I like it because it's hard Joanne I think I do it all in the morning I do it at it started  6:30 wow he shows up at 7:00 this is what my Monday Wednesday Friday goes like this for me from 637 I do my own stuff just elliptical elliptical just get going and a few other things you might I might even do those little slides he shows up at

sometimes I go I have to leave few minutes early but like five to nine or so you run right from the gym straight over to tennis oh no missing time and right next door nobody right next to our yeah right door Skipper enhance house okay Bamm-Bamm  yeah and so then I play tennis and then I rush back and I take shower really fast and then I'm on the road and then you do you work now I go to work but I'm up early actually at five o'clock real doing work and I'm looking at videos and I'm reading things and 5:00 a.m. every morning that's your thing every morning I just wake up at that time coffee coffee you lots of coffees and but I get excited about the day I bet that's great I get really excited about that means you're doing what you're supposed to be doing  oh good you enjoy what you're doing I really enjoyed about it I really excited about it I really enjoy what I'm doing and I Joy enjoy my life I love hearing that from people that are successful oh good because it's it means you found the thing that's fulfilling yes and it continually fulfilling yes which is the real problem with a lot of folks sometimes things are fulfilling initially but then they lose their luster yeah but for you as many movies as you made as long as I've been in the game that you're still getting up at 5:00 in the morning yeah  supersize the day not feeling like I have to I just want to that's awesome thanks yeah no I mean it's really true I'm really excited and I you know my my life is good my kids are great you know they've gone through some changes they all kids do and they're really in the right spot you know they're my youngest kid just turned 16 he plays football at Notre Dame he's not a big kid but he wanted to own it he wanted to own a choice and he's really disciplined  really really in and he's he's just so not a pussy he's like you know what I mean he's just a tough guy that's awesome and I'm really proud of him and happy and you know like I go through the rest of the three as well for total what other kind of things do you like to do with your day I mean you're obviously a guy that's into self-improvement yeah so what other kind of things you do meditate at all I do meditate I do TM I do it once a day but I know you're supposed to do it twice a day are you supposed  twice a day supposed to do it twice a day but I having in night is that how you're supposed to do something like that yeah but I don't I can't pull that off so I don't demand that upon myself I don't depend upon myself things that I that I can't quite do I know I should and I'm trying to my sorry my friend Tom pop it does TM and he won't tell me what his Mantra is will you tell me what your Mantra is now - crazy I got I had two of them because actually Deepak Chopra  he years gave me one I 15 years I have to be honest 15 years because I was really in need of meditation to stop these Cycles gave you a mantra he gave me a mutt came to my office taught me how to meditate and gave me a mantra and then I start you know I dropped it and then recently about five years ago Veronica was my wife who is a big shout-out to my Wi-Fi she shout out to Veronica thank you for third shout out to that yeah that's good and so she and  I took a TM from Bob Roth Bob Roth is the founder of the David Lynch meditation meditation center and he's a very good guy to have we could you'll know we're good okay and and so we do that and sometimes we get Bob Roth on the phone because he lives in New York and we'll just do it in the backyard and we'll have him on speaker and will he'll talk through the framework of it and and then he's quiet and we're quiet we meditate  oh nice you meditate yes I felt just find it amazing how many TM people won't tell you there ah there whatever they're chanting we're told not to yeah that's why it's weird it's like what why would this how does somebody have that much power over you right is it Abracadabra is it Alakazam what are you saying I the style of meditation I do I just concentrate on my breath I think only about guiding in only about breathing in and only about breathing out it's all I think about so the when I'm  concentrating I'm thinking only about the breath in and only about the breath out and it goes off the rails I think about other things and I have to get back to track it always does there's no way around that I think old it's okay though right yeah it's okay catch ya I used to think that it wasn't I used to thank God I'm weak he to can't stay on track but now I realize that's not the point the point is to it's just part of being a person just yeah let it happen but keep keep on track keep on keep on track and you get off  track just get back on track again don't ya don't freak out about it don't beat yourself up and all that stuff but I find it very cleansing me too it does something just something when it opens you up in a very nice way is yours who's who was the who's the person that turned you on to it or is it a type of meditation that does a name to it or no not really the stuff that stuff I've read about and I started doing it in an isolation tank I started doing it I have one here really  when I leave we can look at the yeah oh yeah sensory deprivation tank shout-out to the float lab cash you ever been to one ever used one no other amazing should get one it's a great way to visit affordable ones who aren't at their Board of yeah I have done one I have done one and I liked it but I bet there's I can't wait to see yours because I bet there's a better way I did it so makeshift yeah I'm sure yeah the float Labs the most advanced ones and they have a place in Westwood  wood and in Venice they have a place where you can go and rent it for an hour but the the best thing that I found Med is was in inside the tank was to just concentrate on breathing breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth and in through the nose and out through the mouth and I got and that's all I would concentrate on is breathing in and breathing out breathing in and breathing out and then I'll kind of go into this trance when I was inside the tank and so then when I what did have access to tank I started utilizing that  outside of the tank and so I just kind when everything's any if something's bothering me if I've got something that because I'm an obsessive person so I get a thought in my head about something I'm working on or something I'm trying to fix and I just start rolling over my head to the point where I can't get it I can't get it away so then the way I can cleanse that and put my brain back on a good cycle is just concentrate on breathing so I use the same method that would use inside the tank and I use it outside the tank but I want to try  ATM yeah I'm gonna try I'm going to try to do it this month while we're doing these different classes this month I'm going to try to take a class maybe go to this guy Matt broth show me yeah well he's you know kind of all over the in New York okay so but he comes out here because he has many people in Los Angeles and he makes sure to come I think once a month or so okay yeah well I'll talk to you well yeah we'll figure it out I think he's you know for me I think the best I've met a few of them but he  without saying take it seriously he describes it in a way that I understood what it was and he has some Authority in him that made me take it seriously where is the other times they didn't take it quite as seriously it is it's kind of important who introduces it to you yeah I think I think so do yeah yeah I mean it's like what you were talking about earlier about people that are really enthusiastic about something yeah really committed and and  disciplined about it that it's very it's very contagious it is I think the same thing about meditation or about anything yeah there's a certain energy you get when you're talking to someone who's really into what they're into yeah really into if they're really into TM like you'll get a feeling and then you'll be able to recreate at least some of that yes when you do it on your own I'd imagine yes yeah and yeah we all like how it's described its and if you've basically no I'll let you okay do it yourself  okay sorry now what other stuff do you do in terms of self-improvement she should I ask for Hanukkah no I'm I'm content but I think a little like you as I've researched you that I'm constantly reading things like all of the time always nonfiction however no friction at all no I just know that's interesting for someone to produce has a lot of fiction well I would I like is I yes that's right  right what I've found in my life the the like the for me the foundational creative ingredients are ingredients to a creative equation like making a movie or a TV show or painting or is CounterPoint so I have found that I'm Dreaming enough myself you know like I you know what I've read of course all Joseph Campbell stuff so I kind of understand formats  myths and the hero with a thousand faces and and and I particularly like Underdog stories there are so many types of Underdog stories that it's so anyway so I have that basic knowledge and then when I learn a subject let's say learn the subject of architecture or physics or a little bit of chemistry or whatever the you know it's all like from an archaeological perspective because it's all new to me so I found for example when I  reduce the movie 8 Mile which is about hip hop right it's about battles in Detroit first I thought I could even go back further I'll go do this quickly though I thought I'm should get like the hottest you know video director the coolest guy and I won't say those names but they're there were the guys that were very visible at being the best at those videos hot videos and then it occurred to me I should get somebody that  coaches again archaeologically where everything is a discovery so I hired some of the knew nothing about hip-hop what was passionate about wanting to do the movie and he was named Curtis Hanson he's deceased right now but he won I think believe two Oscars for LA Confidential so it was kind of a classic American filmmaker that looked at everything was sort of a discovery lens and that's why you're able to see if I pick the video  oh guy that thinks he knows everything about hip-hop then all the little nuances that are new to the audience's eyes would have never been shot because he think oh everybody knows that stuff that to get the good stuff you know yeah and so sometimes Authority on top of authority doesn't work out well and I found that my my my career I all I did was write and produce comedies for the first 17 years of my movie career  starting with night shift and then splash and Parenthood and Nutty Professor in liar liar and I could you know all the a lot of comedies a lot of five Eddie Murphy thing you know Jim Carrey three times you know and what I found was  Jewish writers  Christian actors in the Jewish words they go Jew writers goyim actor and going him is like when Jewish people say it's the Christian yeah the Catholic got it's always I made eight movies I think with Tom Hanks but he's like the Gary Cooper or he's the Christian guy with the Jewish writers always what is that works why do you wan Zhu no good Christian and Christian not funny  really yeah just doesn't play what's wrong with you anju there's only one Jew anju kind of worked in the last Woody Allen and they weren't meteoric hits he was just like you know he was sort of dominated the ethos you know of you know I mean he of comedy in the 70s and 80s but yeah but it just didn't work  you can't really but youkai could name I mean Judd Apatow talented Jewish writer director usually he's got these guys that are were like not they're just not that they're catholic christian guys you know like our girls right I mean who's the chair the chicken train wreck that Melissa McCarthy McCarthy she's Catholic right he's a Jew it's like that's the the Counterpoint  is what works isn't train wreck any Schumer is it Melissa McCarthy tell you might be right might be both yeah it's both oh thank God thank God we got tiebreaker here so anyway do you prefer to do comedy or do you prefer just a movie that interest you like he's just interest just whatever it is but there was a point like at the end of these 17 years of like make you know what there's a point where I've definitely made a lot of you know did well financially I'm making these  movies and I enjoy it because when you're around comedy you're you're happy you're laughing yeah that's the whole vibe in the front but I thought it just don't you cannot get enough respect just doing comedy so I thought I'm gonna have to try to just do dramas because I have come close I got nominated but that's as close as I got there was no way on Splash there were going to pick and the writers are the funny guys over there they've got to Robert Benton you know like the guy that wrote A Place in the heart you know  no are places in the heart hmm and Bonnie and Clyde like they picked that guy The Classy guys so I felt like if I want to join The Classy guys I better start doing dramas and I did Apollo 13 and Ransom in a bunch of Dramas that's interesting so that's what motivated you to switch it up yeah that was what motivated me I just couldn't take the abuse any longer it's good the abuse of producing massively successful movies but well yeah I mean I felt  grateful and stuff but I just felt like I got understand you did you feel like you got the respect you deserve yeah I just feel like they're so uh comedies or so hard there you do comedy comedy is the hardest thing because when it doesn't work you hear it it's embarrassed it's bad yeah dramas the great dramas I could tell you though all those dramas that we see in the last five years they go it's great it's brilliant I mean I don't even know what happened on some of these things they're so slow right or the my  so you can and you there's no defining you know no one's class you know you're no God you hear everybody is really quite the quiet because they're asleep what did you think of the Joker okay I have to break the Joker down because I know a lot of people that are more realistically very against it yes you know my generation is really mad at it I thought as a movie that movie was really badass that movie was I thought it was really good man  two-piece Masterpiece oh my God those sequences and the going down the stairs and the music choices that was a masterpiece it was amazing I loved it now the the other this other units that you know if they're if the movies broken down into two units the one is the master of the Masterpiece were calling of the movie itself and then what's you know one of the themes that are giving life to this movie or the purpose of what are the what's the purpose I mean you  you could go well that could be you know that guy you know there could be some bad stuff in there you know or but I'm not deep enough to know I could identify it exactly and having made so many movies I can't be judgmental of it I liked it and so I just feel like people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones that I think that's a good way of looking at and how do you see it can't you asked I thought it was brilliant but very disturbing yeah but it was supposed to be disturbing and I think  accomplished their goal you know with flying colors I think it was a very very unusual moving very difficult to find any parallels with any other previous movie exactly thought it was fucking amazing yeah that when I left I didn't feel good yeah I didn't feel like that was like Wow gonna party great yeah yeah I was like fuck I walked out of the theater like fuck yeah just blows you away yeah yeah so good and me and my wife talked about it for a long  long time and I was she on it she loved it oh cool but it's not her kind of movie yeah but it was there was something about it it was so well executed and Joaquin Phoenix was amazing it was kind of operatic and sometimes they mean where the music and everything yeah I mean the build-up to it too there was so much going on and so Much Madness and so yeah you understood you felt empathy for this guy who was ultimately a monster in a  yes but spoiler alert but I felt you felt for him yeah you know I mean in that sense they managed to navigate those incredibly treacherous Waters brilliant yeah I thought it was a fucking awesome yeah good me too no I mean that directors great yeah now he's great you Phillips I'm sure you know him I don't know friends who know yeah yeah my friend Brian Cowen he was in The Hangover and he's in I was in this movie briefly to yeah  okay but I don't know yeah so that's that that's that yeah but I got to wrap this up but okay I really enjoyed it man thank you very very much you're so welcome really appreciate it I really enjoyed talking to you thanks I feel

beer or a soda or something or just just water but not Heineken 0 0 Heineken 0 0 has none of the alcohol but all of the flavor I'm going to open this bitch right now Heineken 0 0 is the result of groundbreaking Innovation that won't compromise on taste  it's brewed with a different technique that allows the Brewers to gently remove the alcohol and restore the flavors that other manufacturers lose during the alcohol removal process hmm in a world of limitations and substitutes it's kind of crazy how close they got it they fucking nailed it it's perfect it really is just like Heineken it just Heineken that doesn't get you fucked up you could drink it while you're driving but don't you'll get  pulled over I mean you can but don't let cop see you but it's not an alcoholic it just but it looks exactly like Heineken but it says zero zero on the label Heineken zero zeros one-of-a-kind Brewing process they've got it nailed folks and maybe you drink too much coffee maybe you don't want a soda maybe you just bored with water I'm telling you I can 0 0 give this a try you can get the Great Taste of Heineken 0 0 and it comes with just 69 calories  you can drink while you're working right how about that you could drink in front of your mom go out and get a six-pack of Heineken 0 0 right next to Heineken original at your favorite local store today Heineken 0 0 now you can my guest today is a very good friend of mine he is an author he wrote sex at dawn and he has a new book out called civilized to death the price of progress I love talking to him he's brilliant and he's just an awesome guy please give it up for my friend  and Christopher Ryan  The Joe Rogan Experience Train by day Joe Rogan podcast by night all day  hello Chris Ryan hello officially it's come on buddy everything you just English looking motherfucker and I just think over that's to go t the whole deal yeah it comes and goes I don't know what you been up to man I've been following your Instagram Chronicles you don't you yeah traveling the world in a van what are you doing Vance apology I call it Civ anthropology tour yeah yeah I love it man it's like you know you and I've probably spoken about in my 20s I backpacked all over the world hitchhiked  laska couple times and you know did all these Adventures a sprinter van that you have a bed in and of cooler and a freezer and that's kind of like a backpack for a older slightly richer dude you know that's how I look at it because you have everything you need with you yeah which is a feeling I love I love just being able to say you know what I'm tired I'm going to pull over and sleep right here and before I do I'm going to have a couple of beers and listen to some music and you know it's like everything I Need Is Right Here Right can you  you what is the deal with pulling over in a sprinter van and drinking are there a lot you know like you're not even allowed to be drunk in the backseat of your own car yeah I believe a if you have a bed it's considered a domicile that's what I've been told I'm not a legal expert but my understanding is that the front two seats are considered the vehicle but beyond that in the back where you have the bed and the all the stuff that's considered your house so a war  and to search is the same as someone coming into your house oh yeah because I know a dude who got in trouble because he was drunk in the backseat of his car because he knew he was drunk and says like I'm not fucking driving I'm just going to sleep it off and he laid down in the backseat of his car and the cops knocked on the door and he opened up the door and he said yeah I'm drunk and I'm sleeping off they arrested him that's bullshit yeah well you know caught some cops they feel  like they have to make a certain number of arrests you know some places have quotas yeah it's just I've always thought that so strange like what happens if no one commits crimes what did they do about the quotas they just make up crimes and how do they fill those presents that are you know dependent upon 98 percent occupancy rate yeah the assume that there's going to be a certain amount of people that fuck up like what happens if something happened some I mean I don't know what it would be other than man  consumption of mushrooms across our people just population breaking laws yeah people just stop they'll just pass the law and you every one of us breaks several laws every day right like there are laws we don't even know exist that we're break like what kind of laws you think God I don't know I read an article about this years ago I'd be hard-pressed to give you examples right now but I'm sure their financial laws and we're all cheating on our taxes not me  me not me not me but everyone I know except for Joe I well I handle my hand mine off to accountants yeah that'll handle that at all but I mean cutting Corners you know we're all cutting Corners Iran to yellow lights on my way here I'm here I probably you know it's four miles per hour over the speed limit hmm so that's how they get you yeah I mean a lot of Thomas Vehicles yeah that kicks into gear that's going to be real interesting when no one ever breaking the speed limit what do they do what is this Jamie six laws you broke  Aunt Jamie where the best man cracked.com always has great articles like this so what does it say what do we got here connecting to unsecured Wi-Fi networks that sounds law what why are you guys so if you go to Starbucks and it's an unsecured or the airport that's their user open for that purpose but like if someone act like your neighbor leaves there's an open up think that's what it's saying right here oh I say to that Wi-Fi squatting what about every time you click on one of you update some soft  and you click agree I have read and agree to this but you didn't read that shit well whether he reads it one of the things that Snowden talked about yes oh yeah about the terms and conditions right that you you accept and who knows what's in there that then you're not complying with when I would have to have a lawyer go over every piece of it and then a lot of is open to interpretation and they can change it a moment's notice right one of the things that you see in terms and conditions is they have the ability to change it without notice which is like what  Sam has had a great podcast with this guy who was an expert in data collection he was talking about what's actually happening now is that we have there's a commodity that commodity is data and we didn't know it was a commodity and then all of a sudden these companies like Facebook and Google made billions and billions of dollars off of this commodity that we didn't even know we were giving up and we didn't know that they had it we didn't know it was valuable and then you know this is no way to  protect it and that's their business model their business model is and then also their business models tricking you into clicking on things by getting you outrage so they're consistently bringing up things whether it's you know Trump or abortion or whatever it is that like gets you riled up that outrage algorithm right going to find your little soft spot yeah oh God tell you just posted something on that recently Twitter Facebook thing yeah Facebook yeah yeah it was an argument that Facebook is the  what it is is and an algorithm that's designed to find outrage so it's not free speech right it's just an outrage accelerometers right well you think about even you know that goes back to William Randolph Hearst you know saying like you know I'll I'll give you the war you know I'll you give me the war I'll sell the papers and get the public behind it because it's good business yeah yeah yeah it's it's an interesting world isn't it is it  are you talking about Tristan Harris was that the guy on Sam Harris is podcast the ethicist I do not know I don't I don't remember I heard him on Sam Harris has podcast he was a I think he has a PHD in computer science and philosophy and he worked at Google as they're like in-house ethicist and then he quit because it's like there's no such jobby evil exactly stopped having that don't be who doesn't exist it doesn't exist I'm crazy is that when you have that yeah let's get rid of that you can be evil  what a weird thing to have both have and then weirder still to remove yeah yeah I went to get a marriage contract that has that clause in it where you can update it without notification you know just get that in there have your lawyer slip that into the pre note any moment you could bail it's fine bail or just change the terms you know yeah yeah I don't know it's a strange World Joe that's why I like being in my van keep things simple well humans are strange creatures  you know and we vary so widely that you know trying to make any sense of putting 300 million of us together on a lot on island descent yeah good luck with that and we vary not only individually but I think we very we become different creatures in different conditions Shore people sometimes will ask me like what's your you know what is human nature what's your opinion you know based on these books and I say it's like asking what's the natural state of a  200 right boiling is it ice exactly what other what's that pressure what's the altitude yeah don't you feel like you're different people with different people as well yeah yeah I had a girlfriend a Spanish she was sure her mother was French or Father's cattle on she was raised in Spain and then lived in Miami which she was 13 to 15 or something so she spoke English really well Spanish French and Catalan perfectly right and we  were living in San Francisco and I was high was smoking a joint she was across the room talking to her mom on the phone in French and then her mom put her dad on the phone so she switched to Catalan and and I was just high enough that I noticed like wow that's not Peggy talking to different languages and at 3 because she would like put her hand on the phone saying my mom said I don't know so English French Consulate it's not Peggy speaking three languages those are three different  Peggy's she's different her facial tics and her movements in her body position changed depending on the language she was speaking right and at the time I was in grad school and I thought this is like multiple personality disorder so I started researching multiple personality and I sort of came up with this idea that language in her case because she learned them all when she was very young reconfigures the brain  in in such a way that she actually has different identities in those languages and next time we were fucking I started talking to her in Spanish and she freaked out she mad at you she like like I was I was a stranger suddenly yeah I just said sighs you know just said like you're beautiful or something she's like get away from me you creep because our whole relationship had been in English yeah yeah it's true  anyway so I looked into multiple personality disorder the story has everything and I don't know if you've checked that out you remember Stan Lee krepner my buddy came down to the pockets with yeah he had done a bunch of research on that and  there was a movie called Sybil yeah I remember that he was the consultant for that move he was also a consultant for Rosemary's Baby remember that the The Possession yeah yeah anyway as a plan ski movie I think so yeah yeah one of the early ones yeah people have with multiple personality disorder the research is bizarre it seems to indicate that people have different physiological states in the different personalities  so you could have a different Baseline heart rate blood pressure you know these sort of damn Baseline heart rate yeah in the different even it's now this is des I don't know how reliable this is but I even read that some people have different ocular pressure so that one personality needs reading glasses and another doesn't what yeah oh my God how much is psychosomatic like really how much how much of who  Warren how you how your body works is dependent upon the way your brain is catching things right culture language personal experience I mean is it all your mood how much you slept the night before you know all these things tie into identity is something we take for granted but it if you start to look at it it's like it's like gravity you know gravity we sort of included in our calculations but nobody has any idea  it's happening right how does that work like own immigrant I tracked the real touchy about it oh really yeah when I brought it up he I think he's we had a weird conversation and I think part of the word conversation was the first conversation that he's had publicly since he's been accused of you know right well the he came back from sexual misconduct yeah well he was you know they found him innocent according to whatever internal right investigation they had you know when they're doing a television show right you know  Terry mm but it's still even if even if he's proven innocent you know you've got the weight of who knows how many people that think you're a creep now right you know and he's carrying that around because he was always thought of as being this jovial yes sweet nice guy so he's a little tense anyway that's why I start out admitting I'm a creep it's good ladies and gentlemen I am a fucking creep you can't shake a Charlie Sheen cannot shame Charlie Sheen but we had this conversation about  gravity and it was weird it was like I was arguing with him but I wasn't arguing it was like I was like what what is cause you like like what causes it and he's like we know he like he went into this whole thing we know what it is we know how to measure it we can make that's good enough for me yeah it was it was a very tense conversation that's interesting yeah what does it is a faith-based thing there you know like he's right they know how to measure it but we also know how to measure Placebo right and we don't know how the fuck that works  we know that hypnosis people can have open heart surgery under hypnosis or have limbs amputated or all sorts of amazing things with no anesthesia whatsoever because I really been done oh yeah yeah yeah have you ever been hypnotized yeah but I don't have high hypnotic ability that differs it's another thing that differs among people and Stanley actually has a really interesting Theory along those lines which is that in prehistoric populations hypnotic ability  would be adaptive because a lot of the healing rituals were keying into Placebo response so if we have a certain ritual if you're susceptible to you know you believe in that like Voodoo there's a hmm you know Voodoo death people died when their a spell is cast earliest because they believe it if you don't believe it doesn't happen so it happens the opposite direction as well with healing so his idea is that that  been a very adaptive characteristic in prehistoric societies where as in contemporary societies it's maladaptive because you're more susceptible to advertising your easier to manipulate yeah hmm yeah so I yeah I've I've when I was in grad school I had some professors who worked with hypnosis and I studied it a bit along the same around the same time I was looking at multiple personality disorder because I was real interested in this  the question of how the brain and the body interact how much of it was all this research showing that people with the same condition and in hospitals exactly the same age same prognosis and all that they heal significantly faster if their Hospital window looks out on trees as opposed to looks out at another building looks like that just looking at something like nature yeah Keys the body into some sort of energy  that helps it to heal completely makes sense I've met people with multiple personalities well Rosanna Rosanna Scotto doesn't she make sure that's true I know another one that's weird one is the football player Herschel Walker I think he had trauma induced multiple personality disorder well does she there's articles it says that Bill Bill Maher reminds us she does and then Roseanne says she doesn't so yeah I think and then the seeds does one says seven having seven personalities is tough her saying it so  oh yeah well here's the thing about Roseanne I mean I'm saying this for the tenth time I guess she was hit by a car when she was 15 and she was put in a mental institute for nine months afterwards she had severe brain damage and she lost her ability to do mathematics and like really scramble your brain and that is probably the birth of the Roseanne that we know the comedian and that's also the case that Sam Kinison Sam Kinison was also like a pretty normal kid and then he was hit by a car  and you know pretty severe brain damage as well and brain damage for especially apparently as a especially has an impact on your ability to be rational and impulsive behavior like people with brain damage a lot of times get very impulsive it's been very so widely you know it's what happens to you dependent upon like what kind of trauma where the trauma is what part of your brain  but when they said about Herschel Walker was always confused I wonder if it was from football like football trauma or was it personal trauma like you know abuse yeah people with letter diagnosed with multiple personality disorder if I remember correctly almost always were severely abused as kids you know and in fact the the rationale is that they develop the alternate personalities as a way of escaping a reality that's intolerable  make sense yeah yeah I mean what people do weird things with horrible memories you know they bury them to the point where they don't even really have access to them anymore yes sexual abuse and some traumatic events when you're young yeah who put the fucking human brain than the way it adapts and molds two things is so bizarre yeah there's a there's an anecdote that is in this book civilized to death notice that segue good segue to thing yeah it's by the  way the art is done by a guy listen to my podcast really it looks like but the art by guy was cheeseburger a chimp wearing a cheeseburger with a nice suit on yeah it's got an iPhone oh yeah the story so there's a species of grasshopper in North Africa that you know they hang out there grasshoppers that they're dispersed they eat grass they chill right  rains come the grasslands expand grasshopper population increases then the rain stopped the grasslands contract to the point where the pain the density of the Grasshoppers triggers dormant genes so there's an epigenetic event in these Grasshoppers and they start to transform and not over Generations individuals front legs get shorter back legs get longer thorax changes shape of the head changes coloring  ages and behavior changes from being these chilled-out solitary relax grasshoppers they start attacking each other they become cannibalistic and they swarm Locust Locust exactly they become Locust yeah so this species of Grasshopper And Locus is the same species it's the same DNA it's just responding to different conditions so you know we're talking about the brain and you know who you are and what identity is and all that and this I was  mind you this when you said you know people are so different and the H2O thing we're not only different as individuals in the same context we change completely given the context wherein yeah so the focus of this book is the hunter-gatherers were essentially a different sort of animal they were essentially you know the parallel is with the Grasshoppers and now we're swarming yeah now we're a different kind of animal even though our DNA is the same well that completely makes sense to me people that live in small towns are so different than  live in cities yeah it's so rare that you find someone as a small town sensibility in Manhattan get chewed up yeah literally yeah literally yeah it's um that's the the Locust things amazing have you ever written or read rather the accounts of the settlers in the you know the pioneer days making the way across the country and dealing with these swarms of locusts and really not having any idea what to do with them and how to handle it eat them yeah you can  Americans 8 mm yeah that's probably a real good move right that's one of the things that people think is probably an excellent solution to some of the issues that people have with meat because a lot of people don't have any problem killing bugs but they wouldn't want to kill a lamb right you know but you can have Cricket proteins reload micro agriculture yeah Cricket proteins apparently like very healthy I've eaten crates yeah I have to in Thailand I've had them in Mexico oh yeah Mexico they they  and fried and we're staying at a resort in where was it I've Punta Mita yeah I think it was down there Puerto Vallarta yeah and they had a bowl in the resort like when we walked into the hotel room like okay yeah they had like sliced mangoes and then they had fucking crickets and I was like all right I'll try that I hosted Fear Factor there's a restaurant here in La that I was at just a couple weeks ago that has all sorts of crickets and grasshoppers always we called it Sam  Mexican place they specialize in moly I don't remember a good Mexican place really good isn't it weird that like there's a lot of great Mexican food in LA but it's like you know like your basic burrito joints and Tacos it's not like gourmet Mexican food it's very few gourmet Mexican plow this place is that it right there yeah that's it that's right couldn't remember the name Jamie wag Wetzel no I just another word it's  like a I don't know if it means party but it's a celebration down I think Oaxaca yeah well Haka serving up insects yeah check it out it's a place I really the moles Fanta where is that at what part of LA on a London Olympics okay deep in the Heart of Texas yeah bam beautiful yeah no way I love mole and and let's face it shrimp Lobster that's just bugs was just big see bugs well we found that out on Fear Factor because people that are allergic to shellfish are also allergic to  roaches huh yeah we found that out the hard way little lawsuit no no if the dude was allergic to shellfish and you had to eat Roaches for this thing and you know they wound up having to give him an adrenaline show then yeah he was seasoned up a little bit and your windpipe starts constricting yeah I'm not allergic to anything as far as I know graduation I'm very happy yeah me too yeah that's a bummer man allergies are above especially for can peanuts I've heard people  analogies are so bad that people will ask you to not eat peanuts on a plane with someone who has a peanut allergy like some people's peanut allergy is so severe that even like the dust of you chewing peanuts on a plane next to them get them sick and and it's interesting to think about the State of Consciousness and how that affects allergies because apparently and again I'm always cautious about saying shit on the show there's so many people listening so  caveat it's been a long time since I read the research but if I remember correctly under hypnosis a lot of people with allergies no longer in fact I remember the research yeah there was a it was a setup where the person could see so like you and I are talking across the table and there's a mirror behind me and in the mirror in your peripheral vision you see roses  and you're allergic to roses you'll have a reaction even though they're plastic roses so it sort of enters the Consciousness and triggers the response subconsciously yeah if I think that's how it was and then with people under hypnosis like Andrew why I wrote about this cat allergies he was tripping it was on MDMA I think and he's playing with a cat and had no reaction to it wow yeah okay this self hypnosis  Welch's allergies picture indeed a Jamie in my life damn picturing ski slopes reduces hay fever symptoms by a third look at that picturing ski slopes how weird what a weirdo I'm skiing huh what cause you're picturing a place where there's no pollen right right yes you could probably picture the surface of Mars to yeah well you've got a needle like you get a shot in the doctors about to give you the shot and you start like tensing up like you feel this like the anticipation to me  is it like your heart starts quickening and you get like really weirded out by it but then you get the shot and like that wasn't shit like why was I freaking out like that but it's this the psychosomatic aspect of it I think that's what life is basically and I'm not sure yeah Shelton and now it's like we're always worried about things we spent so much time worrying about things most of which never occur yeah you know and even the ones that do occur it's like wow whatever like death you know what is I'm not worried about death dying Maybe  if it takes too long but if it's if it takes like an hour or a day to die that's a tiny fraction of your life who gives a shit you're not a guy that really spends a lot of time working on Fitness or health or it's a nice way to put well you you enjoyed that article he's so funny I love you I take it as a compliment you got things to do than work out Joe I get it you enjoy that article that I wrote a long time I did but the same  and yeah human bodies like a sand castle Yeah you can make it beautiful but it's not gonna last yeah it's you and you know that going in you know that way yeah and I and I mean I've got this idea for a book if I keep writing books which is sort of a self-help book but it's a parody of self-help books and so it'll be it'll be calling attention to the way so much of what we do to try to be healthy is actually counterproductive because we stress especially Americans everything's work you know everything turns into work and  in the very suspicious of pleasure we're taught to the pleasure is you know evil and dangerous and all this hmm I've never bought that line of reasoning I've always felt like what feels good generally is good there's a reason it feels good you know now that can get corrupted by advertising and false messaging from a sick society that tells you you know sit on the sofa and drink beer and eat bags of chips all day but if you get beyond that  that and you can actually hear the voice of your body I think if your body is telling you to you know stay in bed because it's a rainy cold day now I know this is totally against your perspective on life where you're like you gotta tame the inner bitch you got to get out of bed you got to work out it doesn't matter I'm like no man I'm staying in bed like you you go do what you need to do I used to climb mountains with his friend of mine in Spain and he was like you he was a fucking billy goat he'd like go up to  and I'd go with him till I got to a nice spot with a nice view I'd be like dude I'll be here when you come down taking a nap got a bottle of wine and some cheese I appreciate that too I'm not married to my perspective but I think I have a very peculiar biology that Demands a certain amount of exertion yeah make sure saline and I friends like that I mean you know lots of friends like man I if I don't run  run every day I feel like shit I'm like running is very addictive though I feel fine yeah you get you get used to that there's a high that you get from running that's really interesting and any long-term cardiovascular exercise you get this it's like we did you know last October we did the sober October thing we had this crazy fitness challenge so all of us were doing cardio like five hours a day like we're really crazy amounts of cardio and one of the things that Tom Segura and I both agreed on is like the amount of  chatter dissipates to 0 I give no anxiety it goes I didn't realize I had any anxiety until that happened and then I was like God it goes to 0 it goes to nothing like when you do like 5 hours on a treadmill or you just running just run when it's done man there's this like peace of mind that comes with that this release of endorphins that's incredibly addictive because that feeling is so  wheezing so it's not that it doesn't it doesn't feel good to get out of bed and didn't to just push when you don't want to but the end result feels amazing it does feel so I like I wonder if there's any research looking into whether that effect happens universally because I've worked out I've run there were times in my life I've never I've never gotten a runner's high never  get my teeth hurt my knees hurt my back hurts I feel my brain bouncing around in my skull you know I'm half a mile into it I'm like fuck this this doesn't feel good you have to get in shape first that's a big part of it it's not it's not that simple it's like for me I never really got into running like the first time I really did any serious running a my friend cam Haynes had a 5K  okay which is what is that three miles something like that so I'm like yeah and I didn't run at all in preparation for it and when I ran the 5K I was like Jesus Christ this is hard like I didn't have a there was no good feeling at all you know it's running on concrete and shit right in Vegas it's gross and Vegas Melanson in the air and but when it was over I was like okay obviously I'm not I'm in good shape but not in good running shape at all so I should probably get in shape  so then I started running and then when I got into running and it particularly running hills then I started feeling it once I kind of got in that kind of shape and then when the you know when the workouts are over like I run all the time now and when it's over I just have this yeah you and Marshall are Ya Doin your thing it's great yeah fucking light and he loves it too there's a crazy bonding experience with that dog you know when because he loves it you know I got my dad a golden retriever  you're the best dog years ago when my dad was like you know I get maybe its genetic is he's pretty lazy he came home from work and he'd seen us in front of the TV and drink vodka and get upset about the news and and my mother didn't like dogs but I my sister and I convinced her that Dad needs a dog because Dad will get this dog and he'll go for walks because the dog needs to walk and so we got them golden retriever he named it Stoli bad sign right there and then and then  he never went for a walk stole just sat next to him and got fat whore stole I know yeah well it's common doesn't always work no yeah it helps me get going because I know that he needs exercise yeah it does but it helps me to and it's fun like I talked to him when we run you know I guess we're running you know I have a little conversations with them yeah cool fun and he's not judging you right really give a fuck I could be fat I got covered in shit  wouldn't give any probably prefer that more interesting yeah it's but the the runner's high is a real thing but you have to achieve some level of Fitness before I think it kicks in yeah I closest I've come to that is the sex hi hmm you know stuff yeah now during quite and outs like maybe there's like a workout element to that ball sacks when you're really aroused and you really attracted to the person like in the middle of the act of it it's like you're on a drug yeah  it can be like this incredible elevation where you your high basically your hi in this short for instance arouse State yeah yeah and you have that that hyper-focus that you're talking about and removing anxiety you're not thinking about yeah you know anything other than where you are it's one of those beautiful moments I had a guy in my podcast recently who's like a legend in the world of  of like high-risk stuff he's a base jumper and he flies those wingsuits what's his name what is his name he lives in Bozeman Montana since dump no that's crazy because my friend Andy stuff lives in Montana to I'm sure he knows him he's he holds the world record for that wingsuit Chen's Stewart could it be man I don't remember I'm sure Andy knows him yeah for sure in Bozeman and this guy's 44 he's been doing it a long time and it's about how old and he is and he's probably probably flat  they're yeah yeah really nice guy but it was interesting like how you know here's this guy who's doing the super high risk adrenaline stuff and like he just had done this thing where he's paragliding with another dude on the Brooks range in Alaska and like just the two of them and they loved land and Camp oh my God you know know where bears everywhere like forget it and then they get up the next morning jump off the mountain and keep going this  but this guy was so calm he was just like it was like talking to Buddha or something he's just like so centered and relaxed and focused his beautiful had a really enjoyable conversation from my perspective anyway because I tend to be kind of scattered and you know tangentially speaking right I'm going all over the place where is he was just like it's just really centered and balanced it was nice you have to have laser focus if you  fuck around with that kind of stuff that's it you don't want to is that the gem yeah Jeff Shapiro that's yeah look at them yeah thanks Jamie looks yeah that's his his Falcon he jie got this Falcon as well right when I was starting to love them yeah it's gonna fucking frog he's all into into flight man he's yeah I guess so yeah he's yeah he's a cool dude those wingsuits man I mean we talk about risk versus reward fuck he told his story he was like he said yeah you know I  had the experience a few times of standing on this toes over the cliff 3,000 feet up or whatever and fist bump with your buddy and he goes and says see you know see you down there he goes and then you hear it Bang Yeah you know like I've carried dudes bodies Out of the Woods you know yeah I've done that too many times he was talking about you know these different approaches and how the young guys tend to be more fucking man I'm they think they're  ball and his age he's seen enough he's carried enough bodies he's lost enough friends that he's not thinking that way anymore you know and he doesn't want to be around guys who are because right he doesn't want to deal with the trauma you know well it's all there's a competitive aspect to it too come on don't be a pussy yeah you know like that stuff can get you killed too because then it's just like sort of hijacks your own way of interacting with whatever the fuck this danger is yeah yeah yeah up here  pressure yeah that's real yeah I start off I'm a pussy I'm a creep I'm a pussy you know like you got no leverage p.m. press lazy you know what fascinates me man mob mentality a mob mentality like like you know if there's like a riot that like physical violence in a way that you would never like a lot of people who would never think about hitting someone when people are hitting people all over the place you'll just dive in like people dive in and kick people  bunch of people hmm it's very weird like bar fights you see I've never seen one in real life I've seen a bunch of them hey does that happen people just randomly punching each other yeah people just punch people yeah I've seen some I've seen some pretty chaotic brawls it's it's but there's a strange feeling in the air it's almost like a smell  you don't like you Jim you not I was in a at a riot and that earlier that the in the day we like we're like The Hornet's Nest is going to explode tonight we kind of felt it what was the premise after the Ohio State Michigan game like 2002 the Ohio State Michigan game I don't really listen to football thing of it but there is a huge day big event we want in a very close game undefeated season for Ohio State's they're headed to National Championship this then meant sofas on fire in the street for like the next  hours and then shortly as the night exploded there was a couple bonfires in the middle of the street we went we her saw that on the news so we went close to see it because we're a couple blocks away as we got close we heard the knee knocker bullets getting fired out so everybody scattered with those rubber bullets yeah from like sweet everyone went from one street on campus to like three other streets then it started up again the street I was on seven cars got flipped over everything and lit on fire so people started trying to like move there  Carson didn't lose it because they're college kids don't have any money whatever a lot of those people got caught on videos expelled from school whatever but at the end of that street I was at we were on and we saw all the riot police the SWAT team like lining up they started firing out tear gas everywhere a tear gas canister ended up on the porch of the house we were in like exploded in the house almost like we were all coughing and had to get the fuck out of there lasted for a couple hours like no one died anything like that there was a lot of violence but just 12 to 15 cars got fucked up the thing is somewhat could have died  that's what's really that's what's really crazy about those chaotic moments of violence is that when when something's in the Air Act and you see like a big brawl going on it's like everything seems it seems like civilizations flimsy like for that brief moment I think there's a natural thing that kicks in with people that sort of allows them to act in war and allows them to act like when the tribes invaded like when you know when  neighboring Army invades your village there's some thing that kicks in where you like recognizes violence and you just look to swing on anybody that's around you and you see it in these these brawls when you see some sort of a riot like you see these people and you like I guarantee that guy's never punched anybody before in his life he's running over trying to punch people and everybody's punching everybody and people are swing in and you know you see it in these fucking whenever you see like like an antique  versus proud boys type thing you know what I mean like these left versus right Trump supporters versus Bernie Bros and DC chaos about online or online I haven't read those in person but when you see these moments where all these travel moments where it feels like it could break out into violence at any time Sofia is a smell in the air it's like it changes the atmosphere of the air and you feel like you got to protect yourself like anything can happen at any moment  Aunt from people that you would never think of as being violent like you would net you mean you would never assume that these folks would be violent to then they don't look scary they're not scary looking people but everybody just seems to get out it's like a thing happens like the Locust right like a little trigger happens with people Armament yeah havior patterns yeah yeah often wondered about what that is because I've been around it a bunch of times and why was around at once big time in high school when I was in high school when I was in high school there was a  kid who lives in this really nice house and he'd moved into the neighborhood for the first time and he decided he's going to have a party to meet meet a bunch of people make friends and people start robbing his house and a brawl broke out I'll never forget it and I was there I was there at the Event Horizon of the brawl I was there at the moment it happened a girl did something to a guy I can't remember what she did I can't remember she threw a drink in his face or she hit him I don't remember but I remember him hitting her because I remember him  I remember him pulling his hand back my all my guys gonna punch her in the face and boom he punched her right I mean like he knew how to punch to it was like a real punch to face the girl goes unconscious and then you know she falls back and then chaos I mean people diving on top of people piles of people out in the yard everybody's fighting everybody just ducking it's like a movie and then and almost everyone has no idea what they're even fighting you know I saw the moment it happened  they're kind of wish I could remember memories so sucky no it really is I have like yes blurry slides but I do remember that fist hitting her face because I remember he went like this I was like oh no he knows that a punch and he went bang they just cracked her in the face and she just looked her head went back and she went out cold and I think somebody caught her I think someone caught her as she was going down and then it was just melee and I'm but I remember the feeling in the air cause that was the first time I  I've ever been around anything like that I was like whoa It's piles of kids fighting on the you know all The River Fighting know I was running away from everybody there they get the fuck out of here yeah man I always did martial arts by was very very rarely involved in any extracurricular altercations so I just got the fuck out of there and the other time was when I was a security guard for Great Woods Great Woods is a place in Mansfield Massachusetts was like this concert venue and Neil Young was playing the vault  people and there was a there's a lawn area it's like left in his bed have you really yeah I can't tell that story so shit yeah nevermind various race so it's an Amphitheatre so there's this like this covered seated area and then behind the covered seated areas is gigantic lawn area and I remember it was cold out I remember what the deal was but people started lighting fires on the lawn like little bonfires and then it's just been chaos broke out we started trying  and the security people started trying to put out the fires until people stop and then people started hitting people and just crazy and I always kept a hoodie with me because I'm you know it's getting like $9 an hour or something like that right not gonna get shot for nine dollars an hour a beat-up fuck this so soon as shit went crazy I put my zip up I put my hoodie on them like I quit I quit the job nice and tassels as I was leaving has I was quitting I was watching people just beat the fuck out of people's like dodging my way through this thing like it  out of here with this stupid fucking job you gotta know when to leave it was a feeling it was like there's that fucking smell in the air like anything can happen at any moment now right yeah I mean you think about these dudes who come back from war with PTSD you know again it's this Consciousness context dependent Behavior where you know they they do things in that situation and then they come back to the normal world it's like coming out of a dream and it's hard to believe you  did that you know it's hard to believe that was you and how do you integrate that into your life with your wife and your kids and Mom and Dad and the neighbors and it's yeah I mean yeah those four guys they're dealing with some real heavy shit there and no one tells you how to do that he knows how to do it right yeah and no one gives a shit right like once they get there you know get you to go do what they want to do then you know it's hard to even get you know is what a two-year wait for any sort of psychological counseling is it really yeah  hands on the state but at least that I had a guy on the podcast actually the one Jamie showed his right before the wingsuit did was a dude who'd been in Iraq and then he came back and worked as a SWAT team Commander you know so he was like doing all sorts of really heavy stuff and then he just got out and now he's living off grid in Idaho raising three little boys with his wife and he's a former Marine  Mormon so he sort of talked about how his Mormonism taught him to respect authority and and do what he was told and and you know that just fed right into his experience and the Army and with the police and but Manny I have so much compassion for those guys who get out and like look back and say what did I do you know yeah who was that guy where how and how they  it's sort of like stop that like stop the thought process when they come back into civilization yeah but still have the memories and how do you trust yourself right you know that I'm not going to hurt anyone else you know yeah it's hard and yeah like like we're just saying they get very little support you know they are sent off to do this horrible stuff and then they come back and it's like okay now don't do  anymore yeah the the incremental progress that we achieve as a civilization is it's amazing but also so frustratingly slow that no one I mean no one I've ever talked to thinks there's going to be a moment in our life time with is no war no one no one thinks is going to be a moment in our life time with this no murder no one thinks is going to be a Moment In Our Lifetime was no rape where we just we just figure it out like I'm pretty confident if it was just the three of us forever  no one would rape anybody no one would murders the three of us three of us Sharona but you know what I'm saying because I'm probably the victim here but you know I'm saying like wet what number of people have how many people do they have to be yeah before one of those things becomes possibility yeah but what if you have a group of close friends a group of group of close friends who are good communicators and good honest healthy friendly people can live together and you know whatever issues you might have with someone not doing  dishes or someone forgetting to put back your lawn mower whatever the fuck it is you could work that out it's no big deal like what is what's the number of people a hundred and fifty okay that's done bars and unbiased way yeah I'm sure you've heard about that yeah I mean that might really be it might be really be what we're program for that's what hunter-gatherer that's where hunter-gatherer groups always Splinter yeah they never get beyond that and I think that's why because you know a hunter-gatherer Group which is egalitarian and sharing and cooperative and all  that by necessity right because that's how our ancestors survived is by taking care of each other mitigating risk you need reputational damage and if everyone doesn't know everyone reputational damage is no longer effective so if you let's say you go in you're a good Hunter and you kill an antelope and then you don't share it and you just keep it for yourself  that's not going to go over real well with a hunter-gatherer group you're going to be ridiculed chastise may be expelled from the group maybe have a hunting accident and died because that hoarding selfish behavior is extremely Taboo in a hunter-gatherer Society whereas you know you look at our society where reputational damage is no longer functional outside of your group of friends as long as you're good to your friends your golfing buddy  you can screw the rest of the world you can not pay your contractors for years and become president right you know everyone yeah everyone in New York I worked in real estate in New York in the 80s everyone knew who that guy was and what he was up to and the you couldn't trust him he was full of shit and he ripped everybody off and but that's how business Works in New York even the the company I was working for is really interesting to see how  your leverage increased when you owed somebody a lot of money you know is this that truism if you owe someone five bucks you have a problem with you owe them a million bucks they have a problem you know I really see that but yeah I think it's a hundred fifty is the cutoff for how many people we can keep track of I think dunbar's number is proved to be pretty accurate well it seems to be what we what we evolved to sort of be accustomed to right  that's the one that is number your cortex that's you know Dunbar was looking at the brain anatomy of different primates and by looking at the proportion of a neocortex to the rest of the brain he predicted the maximum Social size of those primates of each of the species wow and that's how he came to the estimate of a hundred and fifty for humans and then they went and looked at people they did you know data collection so crazy yeah they can see the physical size of something like  like that that there's a direct correlation like like the direct correlation between the size of primates testicles and the amount of promiscuous females in the area you've read sex at dawn yeah finally a long time ago man I read it a long time ago I'm thinking I might do I did the audiobook of civilized to them which I really enjoyed that process I'm thinking I might do a tenth anniversary director's cut audiobook of sex at dawn did you do the audio version who did  actors yuck yeah oh yeah yeah Steve rinella he wrote a book on Buffalo the American buffalo you know just the history of buffalo in this country and someone else wrote it and he finally got the rights back and he did it himself now yeah but just tell her I'm gonna build him because the person who read it it was like a soap opera actor right had no connection to the material at all and in sex at dawn there's a lot of there's a lot of jokes and you know sort of Raya sides and stuff  the people who read it they don't get it they didn't get the humor so it's just the straight ahead it's as if you know someone took your comedy material and just read it in a monotone it's that's called come on criticizing me in a blog do it someone takes it and just puts it in quotes like that yeah yeah good point yeah there's no delivery there there's no voice it's yeah yeah I'm looking forward to that and I think I'm going to I don't know if Steve did this or not but I think I'm going to as I said a director's cut so  I'll let you know when I read a paragraph that reminds me of something or do you know what I thought when I wrote that or you know my dad really wanted me to include that phrase or you know whatever little asides so there will be some commentary as well I think yeah that's a good move yeah JB's Goggins had a really interesting way he did his he did his book where he actually didn't read it he had a friend read it and then in between paragraphs they discussed all the different events that happened that he talked  about and he gave other details that weren't in the book right so the audio book is essentially an audio book / podcast yeah yeah so you're not just getting a reading of the book you're getting bonus material is well yeah it's really good it's really good that's yeah I mean there's no rules of that kind of stuff you know it's your book right and kind of do whatever you want you could even talk about how you feel now about that chapter sure you could always what I would  change yeah yeah yeah or how you feel about the material itself and but how you interact with the facts that you uncovered verses before yeah do you there is a I don't listen to audio books much but in the van last summer I listened to the Keith Richards autobiography oh yeah yeah it is interesting he reads like the beginning and then this actor who sounds like him oh no has the same accent reads most of it and then Johnny Depp  breeds a couple of chapters and then Keith comes back at the end well that was one of the weird things about Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas was Johnny Depp reading Hunter Thompson and then in a wet you know honestly did a better job of reading Hunter Thompson than Hunter Thompson has done reading Hunter Thompson yeah you know there's that famous speech about being there at the end of the 60s and watching the waves pull back to her you know that it crashed  the Rocky Mountains and then rolled back and yeah see that's a fantastic speech but the way Johnny Depp said it was better yeah like he have you ever seen breakfast with Hunter yes remember he freaks out about that particular yes it's because you who is it Alex what they were going to animate they're going to animate it yeah and he fucking pulls out the gun and kick them off the property and totally loses his shit you're gonna take the best thing I've ever written and make it a fucking cartoon yeah amazing  yeah that's how I used to go off he was so crazed you ever meet him know angry angry that I never met him yeah yeah I would love to meet him yeah and you probably are probably a few years there where I could have could have yeah fuck yeah it's a few people Dick Gregory he's one that I really wish I met them I would have loved to talk to him about what it was like to show the Kennedy assassination footage on Geraldo Rivera like ten plus years after the fact  you know the Zapruder film yeah he introduces a Pruder film to the world really yeah Dick Gregory is like meet him a black comedian yeah right yeah yeah remember yeah he brought the Zapruder film to Geraldo Rivera and they played the Kennedy assassination on television should hadn't been seen no publicly known only to not been seen publicly I believe Time Magazine owned it I think they bought the rights to it so you see if that's  and they shelved it for I want to say 12 years it was like 75 when it aired on television somewhere in that range and you know the assassination was 63 was 63 and think it was 63 I was born in 62 yeah yes it was right after I was born and so no one had seen his head go back into the left until that footage  and then people like wait what the fuck really which doesn't necessarily how did it Gregory get the rights I do not remember huh I think I don't remember who else have you met Verna hertzog I've not are you into him yes yes he's here man is one of my all-time favorite movie too it's one of the best unintentional comedies ever but I don't think it's particularly unintentional there's a fucking moment in that film where the sheriff when the sheriff's talking  like the body and they can't carrying the body off and bags yeah it's like you know what did you think well first time I heard about it I thought he was retarded and then they could just has a smash cut to the Sheriff's face and I'm fucking howling yeah I'm howling laughing and I'm like this guy did this on purpose like there's so many Cuts in this movie that are so humorous yeah I got to thank that and Werner herzog's have you ever heard him on Eric Weinstein is podcast you know brilliant guy oh yeah he's really interesting intense guy  guy and very dark sense of humor yeah well that's why I've thought I was like this motherfucker did this on purpose yeah it made this a comedy so do you think that was the name of the character Timothy Treadwell yes yeah yes what I watch that movie my feeling was this guy is closeted gay dude hundred percent yeah you felt that too he brings up if I was gay it would be easy but I'm not gay right so he says because he say why  and I find a girl you know is like walking through the woods with this like lispy gay way of talking yeah and he's talking to the different people don't know what this documentary is about is about a guy named Timothy Treadwell and Timothy Treadwell was well I guess you could say he was a bear expert but not really because the real bear experts were like this guy doesn't know what the fuck he's doing get out of there like what he's doing is ready doesn't need to protect these Bears he's pretending that he's protecting these Bears he's living with them I think there's a certain element of  of it that was suicide by bear yeah I really do and he was walking through the woods holding this camcorder getting filmed going if I was gay I'd be so easy right talking to the camcorder as his only friend yes he's out there alone for months yeah every summer but no one who's not gay says well if I was gay he would be really easy and last year that a lot jealous you're being funny with a friend yeah like well if I was gay I'll just hook up with some dudes but he's saying it like why can't I find a girl if I was gay be so easy  you still live in the woods with monsters going to get a bunch of gay guys gay guys they want to be in Boystown okay they should remake the movie in a bear bar on Broadway that would be hilarious that would be hilarious there's a yeah instead of doing it with the forest and actual grizzly bears in the West Village yeah yeah if I was gay be easy there's bears everywhere I went to a beer bar with Andrew Sullivan and  Dan Savage there's there's actually a bear borrow their lots of beer bars they call him bear bars yeah that's yes for people don't know what we're talking about bears are big hairy gay guys gay guys think Tom Segura and Bert Kreischer they do a body could actually two bears 1 K Vo do it yeah that's hilarious but neither one of them was gay but yeah that's not the point but if they were gay they would be beard yeah yeah I don't know Bears Dan Savage is a trip I've had him on the potty yeah yeah I know I saw that  interesting he's an interesting guy he's he's super smart and funny as shit and he's armed with nothing but a sense of humor and a great intellect and a big heart he's an honesty yeah he's changed the world he is saved through knows how many lives you know he's a he's beautiful I really liked Anna yeah when someone can just be themselves again you know that's who he is and Timothy Treadwell if he had listened to Dan Savage everything would be different  well that leap man that coming out leap fuck's got to be so hard for people I know several guys that are closeted and it's torturous yeah torturous to see and one of them you know I've talked to him I was like just come out man and one gives a fuck we don't care you don't care you little be a giant relief Yeah just they worry about especially yeah actors yeah they're worried about the careers yeah yeah I mean you know when your  more important than the Integrity of yourself I don't think it hurts you I don't believe it yeah I don't believe it the only thing that would hurt with actors is leading man yeah Rock Hudson kind of guy yeah leading that's one thing that's fucking real like if you're a like I don't know if Tom Cruise is gay but that's always been stupid rumor right let's let's let's assume it's true yeah if he did come out of the closet man nobody wants to go see a movie where he's the leading man he's got a wife and kids your be like that guy sucking dick look here  he'll never buy into it that's the like a gay woman like Jodie Foster right could easily play a straight woman in a movie and no work are fine but when a gate that's the that is the fucking glass ceiling in Hollywood it's one of them right when a gay man comes out of the closet those roles John Travolta whatever it is whoever whoever would be I don't he's gay either but if he was that's the fucking that's that's where the buck stops you cannot be the  man who's the married guy with kids yeah or the hot man who's in a sexual relationship with a woman if we know that you're having sex with men but then it's funny right we can watch straight actors pretend to be gay like Brokeback Mountain shorts no problem sure no problem yeah very strange yeah it's it's that's one of the last open prejudices  that we all accept because no one's been able to bridge that Gap except what's that dude's name that fucking is got three names will skinny guy used to be on a sitcom How I Met Your Mother Neil Patrick Harris yeah that guy's Doogie Howser yeah that guy he's openly gay and did he play a womanizer on a sitcom I think on how I make my other yeah yeah I've never watched it but but the thing about sitcoms is there like plays like those kind of sitcoms in front of an audience or horseshit you know  like it's not it's not like a movie there's for shit you know you know it's horseshit everyone knows it's horseshit anything with a laugh track very suspicious or studio audience like Happy Days like I love Henry Winkler but the Fonz yeah that's horseshit no weight is Henry Winkler today no I don't think so maybe I always assumed he was because he was so overcompensating with the Fonz I think there was a character named him in real life he is the nicest guy I've ever met yeah he's a male friend Barry now right yeah he's  he's an acting coach and Barry I haven't seen it I hear it's never seen Barry He's a fly fisherman he wrote a book on fly fishing and I think the books called I never met an idiot on the river because like there's something about fly fishing fly fishing is a very weird Pursuit because a lot of it is Catch and Release yeah which as a person who enjoys the outdoors and enjoys eating fish that I catch I'm very torn on that  activity a catch-and-release activity I know it's fun and I have done it I get it but it's weird it's weird you're sticking a hook through sizes the fish it's got to they got a how many of them died well fly-fishing very few because you're dealing with barbless hooks for the most part so it just goes into this cartilage in their mouth they don't really feel and then allegedly don't really feel I don't know if they feel it and then you know they pull it out and they're  fine but there's some Catch and Release especially with like three prong Barbed hooks where the animals definitely die you know they get they get caught in their gills and they start bleeding from their gills and you have to release them anyway because it's you know some places the regulation is Catch and Release yeah but people love doing it they find like piece like drifting a flypast this area where the fish is lying dormant and then you pull the fly and then the fish grabs it and he got them ho boy but you're tapping into this  sort of Primal reward system that you have in your DNA that makes you want to catch these fish but it gives me a reason to be out by the river in the morning normally it's morning or dusk when the Flies are landing I think a lot I've been hunting but since the last time yeah when I spoke yeah bowhunting you went bowhunting yeah yeah on Hawaii Big Island oh actually went a to trip with Kyle Kingsbury yeah Ben Greenfield and I wasn't deer  this deer trip to mallik you have a bow I do how do you how often you practice since I went hunting not much but before I went every day yeah I was I was in gym coach know I had some friends who you know helped me out and I watched some you know cam your buddy I'm here yeah I watch some videos but yeah it was it was an interesting experience so first I went on that trip with  yeah Peter Tia Bhatia and Ben Greenfield like all these podcasts human optimization guys whole thing up my buddy Kyle tear mender is Big Wave Surfer he spends a lot of time in Hawaii and he knows a lot of people there Healy Jeff Healey I think big big Surfer Dude anyway so he knew all these people and I guess Aubrey and some other those guys sort of asked him to hook them up with a trip  and so he put it all together and then at the last minute I think Aubrey couldn't go I think because you were coming down to Austin and he wanted to coordinate with you or something so they said yo Chris if you want to go it's all paid for and I'm like helicopters Hawaii yeah so did you have to practice leading up to that or where you're already shooting a bow I was already shooting because we had my Kyle and I Kyle Timmerman and I had already planned  planned a trip for like three weeks after that so I was already practicing for that which was going to be a pig hunting trip on the big island but then I went on this deer thing but mainly I want on the deer thing just because it was an opportunity to fly around in helicopters and see Molokai which is amazing right but I didn't hunt on that because I didn't honestly I didn't want to hurt anything mmm you know I wanted to feel like you were a competent enough with it oh and want to do it at all  the deer are farther away and they're much harder they're much more aware and like socking them's a lot harder and so I just basically hung out and had a good time they're so hard yeah they're so that that animal Axis deer is an animal that evolved to get away from Tigers right there the fastest thing I've ever hunted yeah far super alert I kinda did with campaigns and look I know on Lanai and John Dudley just just before you guys went  went and we were there between the time we were there and when we were there the last spring there was a hundred and fifty Hunters that went there to bow hunt one was successful really everyone else pulled out a rifle huh everyone else is like fuck this because you can't get anywhere near those goddamn things without them jumping but if you can get your stocking skills down or you can sneak up on an axis deer and kill one with a bow holy shit that's that's black belt level stuff  the dude's I were with Peter Atia he he got two or three I remember he's very very very into it yes a super super smart guy yeah he's cool and I enjoyed hanging with all those dudes but then the next you know three weeks later we went Kyle and me and Simon Rex on a few know him he's a actor slash comedian slash comedian harassed Dirt Nasty rapper yeah he's a good friend of mine anyway we went on this pig hunting  I'm trip and that was interesting that was you know I said I wanted to have the experience because I've never hunted I never killed anything and I eat meat so I felt like I have this you know responsibility to have the experience and confront it and all that and I was actually the first of our group to to kill a pig and it was strange I didn't feel sad or traumatized I felt  heightened awareness you know like but I I think I might hunt again I'm probably moving to Colorado just bought land in Colorado yeah but part sort of south-central it's a tiny little town and  yeah it's a interesting area there but anyway there's a lot of elk hunting there mmm and I'll probably do some elk hunting with local people you gonna do with a Bogan no I think I'll use a rifle yeah cuz think that's the way to go yeah not going to be completely obsessed and do it every day I'm not yeah because I don't do that yeah and also I don't you know the thing about a bow is and maybe this is what you're implying here if you're not really good the chances of you of an l  running off or a pig running off with an arrow in its ass and dying a slow horrible death is quite high if you hit him with a rifle high-powered rifle with a scope you know and you're in the middle you can still wound them but you it's your much more competent with a rifle and it's a better it's a better meet Gathering tool right but good way to talk it yeah describe it and Colorado has I think twice as many elk  as any other state real entry yeah Colorado is one of the best places in the world to elk hunt yeah so that's a good spot if you're looking and also you're taking a life you take an elk that's a lot of meat I shot this pig it was about you know it was a yearling I think it's not a lot of meat on a pig that size so yeah it's but it wasn't it was interesting are you living in this van are you know I haven't of our is I still have an apartment in LA but I'm about to give it up I think just to just be out  Nomad yeah cuz I mean I was in the van all the five months and it's like okay I'm paying rent to what like forget to leave my clothes their base right like I don't really need to be doing that now I admired that sort of nomad sense of life I had my I don't ever see myself doing it yeah but there's a romantic aspect to it that's undeniable your life's different man you have kids you know you're you've life here that's really you've built over a lot of time  you know I just got here a few years ago prisoner to that though in a certain way you're a prisoner to all your obligations There's real sure that's one of the things that go man took about this nomadic thing that you're doing yeah it's like you know I have to come here I have certain amount of podcasts after week but you're still Takin oh you don't I don't I don't I mean that's what I was thinking that we're talking about the you know closeted gay actors what what is money worth if you can't buy your freedom with it your freedom to be  who you are right as a closeted gay person right let's say what is it good for I mean that's the first thing closeted gay folks the real problem is like the feeling that you're going to be rejected if you come out I think that's entirely different than someone who gets wrapped up in jobs like my other things I could say about the jobs that I have is that I really do enjoy them like I'm enjoying this conversation I love talking to people yeah I love doing stand-up love it and I still  enjoy doing the UFC those are my three jobs and I don't do the UFC as much as I used to would you do them all if you were making a hundred grand a year total  um I mean I certainly obviously could live off a hundred grand a year yeah that's what I made a year so so the money isn't what makes them fun no it's not it's the thing itself the definitely but that's what's made the money what's made the money is my up in a think right I think it's my enjoyment of the things right that's made them interesting like one of the things about podcast and I think there is there is a parallel and stand up is that genuine enthusiasm  yasm like real legitimate enthusiasm is contagious yeah and if you're genuinely interested in talking to people genuinely curious it's interesting to listen to right and you know you do your best to get out of your own way and you do your best I do my best to not be annoying and fuck up sometimes it just know there's no if ands or buts about it here I'm a human being and I've done but you cop to it when you do which I think is another thing that's endearing and  you're really interesting case as I'm sure you know and I've watched you even since I've known you like your profile has moved much closer to mainstream American you know popular you were you were mentioned on fucking Saturday Night Live a couple weeks ago yeah we're right you know and there where there's some article about Joe right where was it in Harper's or the New Yorkers something recently I read like super mainstream but you're really interesting because you're like this man's  man but you're also vulnerable you know you're also like you admit when you fuck up like you had someone at the Twitter guy on and you're like yeah Dorsey I wasn't prepared I fucked that out and you had him back and that's cool that's and it's probably I don't know is it hard for you to maintain that kind of humility when you're getting all this pressure and opportunities and all this stuff coming at you no I don't think so no I think that's just being honest you know if you  I mean I think if I'd stopped if I fucked up and I stopped admitting that I was fucking up it would all go off the rails doesn't no way I couldn't maintain who I am I would be thinking about it all the time right you'd be like back to the closet a DVR closeted you beautiful bullshit artist must be exactly yeah you just be pretending you're cooler than you are I think part of being a human being is making mistakes it's a messy thing to be a person you know and I mean I want also big on forgiveness  and I think you have to be  because human beings are fallible and like we're saying we we vary from moment to the next and to try to hold someone to who they were six months ago or a year ago or five years ago or what they said or what they did and not accept it and hold a grudge to me that's crazy I don't like what you do you want people to do that to you or just that's what kind of life is that what kind of civilization are we creating where people hold grudges and yeah and and don't forgive  people for things of the past but you also have to be able to forgive yourself that's I struggle with that way more believe it or not that I struggle with forgiving other people right I can forgive other people pretty easy for whatever reason I've always been able to you know I've always so what's the difference I'm super self-critical and I have definitely some sort of obsessive compulsive disorder that allows me to get really good at things because I obsess you know it's probably unhealthy but I managed it but like the main  Nia that goes on in my mind I just figured out a way to put it to use right it's like okay I got this fucking engine like what do I stick and I let me stick a thing in there and I could drill a hole with that instead of just having it going where a lot of people do a lot of people don't find a focus for whatever Mania they have going on in their mind so I've found various things that's one of the reasons why I don't ever see myself not doing anything I don't have enough time that's my issue there's a lot of things that I love to do  yeah that I just don't have the time for do you feel like you're how old are you 52 do you feel like you're you're sort of figuring things out always yeah I mean like I have this sense 57 I have the sense that like  like I don't know like I'm I finally learned to dance and the party's almost over yes you know what I mean the great way to say it that's Alaric and finally figuring this shit out and I'm almost 60 well I remember when I was like 26 25 and when I first came out here I remember thinking by Point by time with 52 I'll fucking everything solved you there's arbitrary numbers  we have in our head of who you should be yeah at 50 or 60 or whatever the number is and that's your just alive man you just alive and while you're alive you better forget about all those numbers if we get everyone to thinking like now the year 2000 in the year 2000 comes like what's that going to be like wow I'm going to be so old and yeah dude it's almost 2020 and it's going to be 2020 in a couple months that's crazy  that is such a Nutty number that's so crazy yeah well that's why I love living in a van dude yeah I mean I've you know so much has happened since you and I said I don't know a year or so since we've seen each other yeah my dad's died I'm living in the van eyck this both come out like all this stuff happening but I've spent most of the time sitting by a campfire looking at the stars you know it's fucking the times that I get outside like when I elk hunt every year  and I spent time particularly in Utah in the mountains the place that we go it's just it's cleansing in a way that is so hard to describe it's so hard to describe what it's like just to be out there in the woods and being the forest and be with the wild animals and you know it's your home yeah that's what this books about I don't mean to push the conversation to the book but that's why I wrote the book like we are designed by Evolution civilized to live well now  available at bookstores near you in Amazon and all that other stuff we're designed to live in that world yes so that's why it feels so good that's why golf courses look the way they do you know even fucking you know old Executives love being out there on the grass and the water and the undulating Hills the African Savannah wow and even when it's manicured right still feels good it feels good to be connected to Nature feels good to be on a lake yeah Lakes are the best man do you'll sit on the  talk of a lake like there's a feeling of like you know you look out you see tree ever been a Quarter Lane yeah they're the summer I haven't but a friend of mine has a house there and I saw a picture of the water and like you look all the way down a hundred feet deep down you see the bottom like it's like a piece of glass yeah this is bananas yeah I didn't take a shower for about three months it smelled amazing I smoke gray because every morning I jumped in a river oh it was you know every ounce yeah oh yeah use soap or know I know even use soap  open the decade oh Jesus me smell okay how weird yeah my microbiome is working well but there's are denoted have written about that by by people that say you shouldn't you so ya know a lot of them because you're disrupting your microbiome yeah you don't stop I mean I use deodorant there's Coeur d'Alene yeah Saint points really nice to Idaho's great Idaho's gorgeous I love Boise yeah my and Montana Western Montana yeah man saying yeah look how pretty that is though goddamn that Lake  And yet when you have a boat on a lake it's like you have a car but there's no road everything is a road it's all flat yeah so you can go wherever the fuck you want something for the airplanes some amazing what you'd imagine that's even crazier you and the flying well my friend bill has well he has a helicopter license yeah and he took oh Gilbert yeah yeah yeah he took me around his helicopter that's pretty lot about that I was like that might be a cool thing to get into but that's hard he spent yeah he spent a lot of time  learn how to fly and it's expensive Mmm Yeah but a single engine airplane you can die a hundred grand you get a decent single-engine airplane you can go wherever you want my uncle has an amphibious plane so he lands on lakes wow yeah and he used to conceal and on ground to yeah so that's amphibious so it has wheels and floats but did you have to switch things up or yeah so if you just change out the no no you just push a button the wheels retract our own oh shit yeah he forgot what some flipped it  so you don't want to forget how many people fly drunk  yeah I bet they do yeah right well if the weather is good it wasn't an illegal Patrick Swayze thing like before he kicked the bucket we sit we laughing about what are you laughing at something huh Harrison Ford that's right was he drives It Forward might have been might have been might have been or maybe the old dude old dudes look drunk all the time and babies yeah but that is that's that's a great way to  Chief privacy to write like you're if you're a guy like Harrison Ford I mean that guy must be hard for that guy to go anywhere yeah right it's probably real hard for him to go to a regular airport yeah yeah I've got the perfect amount of Fame as thinking about this today on the airplane flying down from Portland I'm like I was in the front row so I had extra like legroom but I wasn't in business class that's where I am in Fame I want to stay right there I got a little extra egg right maybe normal stretch your legs out but some people recognize me but they all  like me if you don't like me you don't know who the hell I am that's nice yeah so you're at a different level there are people who recognize you her like a fuck I guide you you meet nothing I mean you get Rosalie love insurance people nice yeah even you know it's people even people that don't like you they don't really know you all right if they knew you like some image they have nice if you know me you meet me I guarantee we're probably going to get along yeah and if we don't I'm going to work hard to make it undone not uncomfortable yeah you know it's just the thing  about people liking people not liking people a lot of it is this severely limited way of communicating especially when it's one way right if you're putting out a podcast or you're putting out books and they're reading your shit but they don't get to interact at all that builds resentment there's there's a lot of weird resentment that people develop when they listen to you right and they don't get to interact like say especially someone like me who's always talking shit right I'm all hot I talk shit for a living basically and I'm  always giving my opinions and some people have a profit maybe even a strong point that I probably even agree with them and they don't get to say anything so they're sitting in homeless and like fuck this guy I'm tired of his bull yeah you occupy space in their lives yes and but they don't they don't get drove them something yes yes and that makes sense I mean they're make sense yeah yeah crude way of communicating yeah he's one way methods of communication are very crude yeah yeah I mean I was thinking my buddy Simon and I were  in a in a restaurant in Venice and the woman recognized me and like oh I love your podcast and I done gave me your number and I was like yeah I'll give her a call sometimes I was like dude I would never do that you never never you know interact with your fans the you know and then I was like no buts I mean you don't get it she actually knows me like in Simon's case like he was in Scary Movie 3 4 5 he was you know he he plays these characters so when people are like yo Simon like they  I don't know him right they he's this the face they recognize but they don't know the dude right so it's a different kind of thing I really like the van trips what are the events apology thing I'll say okay I'm going to be in the you know Boise At This Beer Pub Thursday at 8 and people show up fifty hundred people show up really oh yeah but it's mainly so they can meet each other so when you do this do you do live shows now do live shows I've never done a live show I've done like  means a couple times have you know we've done we did the was a couple years ago we did the keynote at the float conference in Portland that's a Larry good audience that oh yeah that's a tuned in group of people right but I don't do the shows I just he noted a float conference with Duncan yeah it was great that sounds perfect yeah that's hilarious but it's really just to build community that's what I want to do I want them to meet each other  because they're all beautiful weirdos right right now and flee yeah they are I've never met anyone through the podcast that I didn't really actually like what kind of numbers do you get like what kind of downloads how many episodes telling you know it's hard to know but probably 50,000 and episode or something like that that's perfect yeah that's a good number fifty and a hundred like you know when you and Duncan were on when we're doing this room parade thing it would you know P cuz you guys do you  use advertising and I didn't for five years it was a listener-supported only yeah and then this friend of mine who has this company mud water he was sort of launching that and he was like dude I want to I want to advertise on your podcasting like yeah I love you buddy but I don't yeah yeah I don't do that and then he sent me an email that email chain where he was negotiating with another  podcast that has roughly the same audience numbers as mine and I was like really I'm leaving that much on the table fuck so I started at this point I only do ads for companies that I really like and that I use their stuff so I don't do you know I don't have a broker or any of that stuff yeah I think the subscription model like when people are paying like a pay wall the problem is the growth is so limited  so then you could either just do it for free and put it out there and maybe just sell books or sell t-shirts t-shirts or you know in my case tickets to shows that would work right I'm gonna be in Cleveland this weekend and Detroit nicely jump what's it like to play to Troy's Detroit Detroit I love Detroit people they're fun people they're having their yeah Detroit is not necessarily coming back to where it used to be it's about like what is it come back right you know never going to be an auto  when you get back in shape and you're 70 guess what you never going to be who you were when you were 20 right you know it's not never going to be what it was I mean it was the richest city in America at one point in time right you know during the peak of automobile production I believe it was the rich or one of the richest cities in America and it's a far cry from that now and it's strange when you drive through the town he sees boarded-up buildings and factories and other broken windows and just you could buy a house like a hundred bucks like it's weird it's weird but then  also a lot of like craft restaurants in these businesses that are building up and these hippies that have kind of moved in and you know they're kind of you know making stuff there and there's a lot of cool shit sheep enough to get in and do stuff yeah yeah which is you know if you're a young person growing up there you like you can make something happen and with the internet the your ability to establish a business and your ability to you know to actually get something off the ground so much  different than it ever has been before yeah and and people love a good comeback story so Detroit like a bunch of Detroit made things could be exciting for people like yeah like that to try my pie that yes Detroit made you know as a company called Shinola you ever heard of the watches really nice watches American-made watches they make a bunch of other stuff too like bags leather goods things along those lines but one of the things they proudly say is made in Detroit and it is they make cool shit you know so it's there's something to that  you know but they're the place I'm working out is the Fox Theater and it's just like really fucking cool old theater and what's interesting there's columns and it was back when people used to be able to smoke they smoked in there so much that all the columns are like they have that RNG nicotine sort of tint them but one of the columns was replaced so this one column is like clear and smooth and clean and the other ones like fucking orangey like you  could it seems like go up to with a butter knife and just scrape the nicotine off of them you know but to pop eautiful old building that was made way way way back in the day and they said that when it was first made it was one of the only buildings in Detroit that had air conditioning so people would go to see movies there they would pay to see movies just as they could fall asleep it go in there and just the cool air and they'd fall asleep during the summer because you know people just be sweltering yeah In the Heat of the summer I've done that in Bangkok yeah just go  to a cinema just to get out of the heat nice I fuckin love Thailand man yeah I really really enjoyed Thailand when I went recently yeah last summer it's like people are so nice Foods great amazing it's the one country I'm comfortable recommending to just about anyone yeah because the the sort of Confluence of convenience and safety and ease and it's still exotic and really interesting and very foreign you know I wouldn't recommend India to everyone or  Asia but Thailand is like whatever your tolerance is you'll find something there that works for you yeah I know a lot of Fighters who have gone there for camps for training camps and wound up either moving there are starting camps there or starting Jim's there they just loved it so much I feel like part of their home yeah I've been there a lot probably ten times over the years yeah it's real cheap too yeah in terms of like food eating yeah lodging to best food in the world yeah first yeah  it's good I love spicy food so it means it's excellent and it's balanced it's interesting it's not just like Blast Your Face Off spices yeah really nice I did you go to Laos at all no that's no that's an interesting place yeah I'm good yeah yeah Vietnam is amazing you know Bourdain's one of his favorite yeah he loved it I know I know I was there for three months in Vietnam I didn't dig it that much there's some really  Ali beautiful places but I found I was traveling with Castle de my wife who's dark-skinned and there's a lot of racism she got harassed a lot because everyone assumed that she was a local and with me makes her prostitute and dark skin makes her low class so there was a lot of she got a dude punched her she was I punch ya  kid ran up we were on a motorbike in this rice paddies and this kid just ran up and punched her in the back and then ran off wow yeah young kid like 15 or so yeah it was pretty heavy she got she got like physically accosted three times in Vietnam how long were you there three months fuck yeah yeah so I didn't dig Vietnam that much then we went we got to Laos and it was and there was like I mean it's a tough country they've had  dad I mean shit storm been going on there since the 40s you know or even before that the French occupation and all that so I know I'm not blaming anyone it's not a big part of the heroin trade Laos as well it was during the Vietnam war yeah now I think heroines more coming out of Afghanistan yeah and and Mexico you know they've got the cartels you see the fucking shit that's going down yeah there's the where the government and the armies of  back down and let the cartel run everything yeah well they took Chapo El Chapo son back right yes how chains I mean how is that going to play out yeah yeah it's interesting I'm going to Mexico in a couple of months but I'm going to different part of this where you going chapas way down south on the border with Guatemala there's the I really love it down there there's a town called San Cristobal De Las Casas lets up in the Ponderosa Pines  I made four thousand feet it's beautiful Indian Villages around and they come down on Market day and I'm going to go down there and work on another book what do you when you right now you know it's kind of Under Wraps because I talked about this book way too much and it slowed me down so about Neil Young's bed can we cut that out get a guy in trouble for saying that you were  first I was on the show how fucked up it was at the beginning what did we are you even aware of that what happened so the first time I came on the show I didn't know you write and I didn't know anything about you because I was living in Spain and Duncan I done Duncan shows the first time I'd done a I didn't know what a podcast was I came to LA to visit my parents I had this email from Duncan I'm a comedian you want to do a podcast I'm like sure never met a comedian don't know what a podcast is so I did it we had a good time and after he's like  you know I'd love to introduce you to my friend Joe Rogan I think you guys would get along and you could do his podcast I never heard of Joe Rogan right and no insult intended or I just I lived in Spain I didn't ever watch Fear Factor I'd your whole thing was happening over here I didn't know about it and then I went back to Spain I was like okay Duncan's friend Joe does this podcast it is living room the way Duncan does I assumed right and I went back to span and I was talking to my buddy voodoo's a tattoo artist  just and he's like so how was La has like a cool I did a podcast with this comedian it was really fun and interesting and he's like I you should do Joe Rogan's podcast I'm like dude how do you know Duncan's friend Joe Wright is this whole weird things like no dude Joe Rogan's boo so I tried to tell you that story the first time I came and the point of the story is I'm an idiot I don't know what's going on right I'm oblivious but we got to the point where I said I didn't know you and you were like so would you do gu  Google me and I was like well not really and then and then we had to do a sound check or you had to do an ad or something and it got the story got interrupted and I felt like you thought I was trying to dis you or something I definitely didn't yeah well I was paranoid then you lit up a joint and you pass the joint around neue and I'm like fuck if I don't hit this joint that I'm confirmed asshole here so I hit the joint even though I hadn't smoked any weed and month you dude  and it was this like California weed I'm holding literally I remember I'm holding the bottom of my chair trying not to fall out of the chair and and we start talking and I'm telling the story about a dude that I had met on an airplane and he was super into sex at dawn and then we were gonna do a movie together and whatever and then his wife like took the book away from him yeah remember yeah yeah and and that I was just like fuck I  I shouldn't have told that story that you know this this whole I'm fucking everything up and I said to you can we just because we're like five minutes in at this point and I was like Joe can we just like cut this and start over and you looked at me he said is live bitch you don't remember any of that I do now oh yeah I do now oh man I knew the guy yeah yeah exactly and you were like to say his name and then I said his debut like that he's a  mine are like oh shit I should have said his name and the whole thing yeah and then I left kiss older was here in the studio and we left we got in the car and I said man was that as awkward as I felt and she's like that's the worst I've ever seen you you were Great establish a great friendship yeah yeah no issues I don't know maybe you enjoyed watching me suffer I don't know I do enjoy watching people get too high  it's not a suffer thing it's like I've been there it's a commiseration thing I think I one of the things about these sober October things is you realize like there's so many things that are so much easier when you're not high yeah you know it's almost like you handicap Yourself by getting baked like yeah I was talking to Red Band Brian Red Band about this like we were talking about like how the early days of podcast we would get obliterated before we do the podcast  I asked like 4 years like up until like maybe two thousand thirteen or fourteen like we would had a volcano you know what L is the those vaporizers rise it fills up this bag and you take these big deep hits off this THC vapor and then as soon as you put the bag down and we'll okay let's get going let's start the podcast and be like oh my god what have we done and it was this feeling every time we did the podcast was oh my god what have we done and you'd be in the middle of saying something  nothing and as you're saying like what am I talking about I don't even know what I'm talking about and then you would Psychonauts not that like you would screw things up you get scrambled in your head when there's no pot at all that never happens like you mean you might make mistakes but you know what you're talking about while you're talking about it right like when you're really really high like that there's a lot of times where you're talking about stuff will you literally don't know exactly what you're talking about yeah it's like that split personality thing we were talking about it really  it has so many Pros but it's got some cons like everything in life like like love and and good things and bad things and food and sleep there's pros and cons and then the cons become very evident when you're not doing it you know I still think every time I do these sober October things I always think well I'm going to cut back I'm going to cut back on some weight and I think I did last year like after October I was like I am not going to do it as much as I used to do it do you drink yeah a little  bit like wine beer I love wine with meals yeah if I have a nice meal I love a glass of red wine yeah I like a cold beer and a hot day love that it yeah yeah yeah I love that yeah I lived in do you know I lived in Spain 25 years or something like over there wine is like water yeah you have wine with breakfast it's really oh yeah yeah it's just part of life it's like olive oil it's on everything that's funny because that's just saw a restaurant was at a restaurant I was using the Wrath of the bathroom and they  sign up that said a meal without wine is called breakfast hmm so that's Italian yeah in Spain they like fuck it yeah I mean not everyone's doing it but workers like you see workers in a bar you know they have their sandwiches and a glass of wine yeah some coffee with a little Bailey's in it nothing wrong with that there's nothing wrong with if you can handle it well you know what I got to Spain I remember talking to people like wow example calls  we're and it's not like liquor licenses here like every Cafe serving wine and beer and whatever he just sell it's everywhere yeah and kids are there and it's just you know it's not set aside that's right and the Spanish guy said to me you know in Spain we have many alcoholics but no drunks and it's true like you don't see people puking in the street you know rage and drunken lunatics like you know in the u.s. what about like sports events like soccer games  they sell beer full strength beer I don't remember if they sell wine and yeah I mean Barcelona is a special place I don't know what it's like in Madrid I never went to a soccer game in Madrid but Barcelona the catalans are sort of dry very self-contained people so you know there's no raging and right now there's rioting going on but that's a political thing what are the riding over  Catalan Independence yeah then something happened today in Hong Kong I don't know some something I've been out of the loose at Hong Kong the Hong Kong protests have been going on for so long yeah it's months and months and months it's like intense and chilly now to in Santiago Chile people are rioting yeah shit's getting interesting heating up yeah it's it's a strange time to be alive really is across the board yeah I feel like we're at an  inflection point what's going on Hong Kong fries murder suspect to whose case led to protests interesting well we're trying to trying to take the air out of it yeah I feel you ever read Joseph Campbell yeah so the the hero with a thousand faces is observation that societies all over the world have basically the same origin myth which is the Odyssey rights the person goes out and has all these challenges and faces their fears and  learns all the stuff and then returns home with the knowledge that they've gained and they realize that what they were looking for all the time is actually home right I feel like as a species we're at the point in that Journey where we're turning toward home  that's my that sort of the under overriding Narrative of this book that what we're where we are now is we've learned enough that we can go back to or go toward a way of living that replicates in important ways where we came from so you're doing it you're hunting you're spending time in nature you know we're looking at different ways of raising kids we're looking at paleo  diet fasting controlling the frequency of the light that comes into our eyes at night and they're all these there's this awareness that the way forward requires an understanding of where we came from so I kind of feel when I'm having a good day I feel like we're at this point now this crisis point where these institutions Central institutions of Western Civilization are collapsing around us you know they're just government Wall Street religion  Saul just like being exposed as you know incompetent and useless and in many cases and but we've learned these really interesting things like birth control and passive energy and all the different ways of living on the earth without destroying it and so the sort of metaphor I use in the book is that we're going to live in zoos right but do we want to live in the Calcutta zoo or the San Diego Zoo and I  I feel like you know what we're seeing now is we're clearly in a moment of massive Global change and I hope that what the opportunity will that's being presented is to redesign human existence in a way that's more in accordance with our nature hmm that makes sense yeah that's I'm struggling to be optimistic well I'm glad I'm optimistic to I just yeah I always wonder if the numbers are just unmanageable well  it's why I mentioned birth control yeah right like we know how to reduce global population but people want babies they but why do they want baby cuz it what's the incentive for women I think there's a biological need there's a feeling that something not all women but many women have yeah where they have that biological clock it's telling them to have a baby when they have a baby I mean you've seen women that have children it's it's the most intense bonding the most intense release of oxytocin  the most intense love and feeling of connection with a another living creature that I've ever experienced that I could ever explain to someone and it's a natural part of being a human being it also changes who you are as a person when you are responsible for these little people and then you have love for these little people like Dave Chappelle said to me once something that really resonated he said not only has it changed  and how much I loved it changed my capacity for love and that that resonated I was like that's what it is like a change is how much you changed how I feel about other people and you know the the experience for a man is entirely different than it is for a woman because the woman literally creates the being in her body yes right a baby is growing inside a woman's body and she gives birth to it with a man he you  do what you always do you fucker you know and but now you have a baby and it's undeniable that you love the baby you love your child but you did not have the experience of having it grow inside your body which I think is a connection that's no man is ever going to understand yeah you never going to just I don't think it's possible to understand what a woman experiences when she has a baby growing inside of her body but then what had changed for me which was a  a big one was it made me look at people instead of looking at them like static beings you see the whole thing yeah I looked at them as like oh that was a baby yeah Christopher Ryan used to be a baby was cute too I bet you were adorable yeah and now here you are a grown-ass man yeah I mean this is yeah this is something that's missing in our experience when we don't we're not there and we don't see that little person become a big person yeah you know that that's what that's missing  I feel like I've gained you know this part of what I was referring to earlier where I said like you know we're learning to dance and the party's almost over I feel I don't have kids I've been around kids but I feel like when I was in my twenties let's say I sort of worked this out recently in relationships that I think I think there are three things there's attraction there's compatibility and there's love and I look at a lot of my relationships  with women they had two of those mmm always love ya sometimes the sex was great and sometimes the compatibility was great and very rarely all three of those but I used to think love was a really limited scarce experience in life and the older I get the more I feel like no love is I could love anybody if I spent enough time with them and got to know them I'd feel love for them right you know that's not hard to find it  seems it's everywhere when I was young I thought it was really hard to find well for some people it is you know some people it is it's hard to find someone who loves him and some people are burdened down like you're you're very free in the sense that because you have this unusual way of making money and you have you don't have a lot of needs you don't need a lot of material things some people are very burdened by these needs you know and they're not free and they're confined to a job and it's very difficult for them  to meet anybody right and then they're also stressed out all the time because a bills and horseshit and then work politics and work Dynamics and dealing with the fucking environment of the office yeah and you got a boss that's an asshole who's like you know you have board meetings and shit and everybody's gotta sit there and get cancer well there's an asshole talks you know I feel it sitting in a board table and some guys what we got to do with this company you know write the Matrix I need you  you to be here after work I need you here 9 to 5 I want to see real commitment I want to you know what I'm one of them lammle 7 yeah when I'm leaving at 7:00 I want to see you still here working yeah like what ya know and then it's hard to meet somebody it's hard to find love ya okay you're certainly you're right about that I didn't really mean in a dating sense so much as just like compassion since okay you know what I mean but that everybody's lovable sure you know like one of the things that I love doing it  podcast is meeting somebody who's never told their story before and never even thought of their life in terms of a narrative and in the course of the podcast having them realize how fucking interesting they are and how interesting their life is but I've had people like break into tears and stuff you know because they've never thought like no one's ever asked right you know everybody's interesting everybody's got some kind of bizarre story to tell  L often they don't know it you know and I feel the same way like everybody's lovable everybody I'm not talking about romantic I know she's saying yeah just like yeah and and you reminded me of when you're talking about seeing the full person's life sometimes I've looked at like women that I was with who you know 35 years old and idealistic see the old lady in them and be moved by that you know like you're going to be a beautiful old lady I'll be dead weirdo yes see that I might  I gotta get out of here before she becomes an old lady oh I see menopause coming get me out of here I want anybody angry at me for shit I didn't even do it yeah no I know what you're saying I know it just happened and I mean everybody's lovable to somebody right I mean unless you're a fucking psychopath I had I had another thing I put on my list here I wanted to mention almost as a public service sleep apnea hmm I have sleep apnea and I have you know about this yeah do you snore I have a mouthpiece  you have the the CPAP machine oh no you do the jaw thing no no it's different it holds my tongue down dry tongue from sliding back real world difference changed everything that's that's why I wanted to mention I like anybody who's got like I was not breathing for 20 seconds at a time and yeah this this woman I was sleeping with like actually counted you know and she's like dude like you're choking you're suffocating yeah so I went and got a test it's super easy  take it home and hook this thing in your finger and all that and they told me I think it was like 25 episodes per hour is considered severe I had 74 every minute I was suffocating to the point where I sort of woke up and like my throat tissue you know the muscles can track so you can breathe again so you're like always at the surface I got one of those machines dude I'm like sleeping again I'm Dreaming it's fantastic  now do you have a hard time put that putting that thing on your mouth and now it's no problem it's like it's like scuba diving you got a regulator you know I mean the one I you have the full face one that goes over your nose and your mouth if you tend to breathe through your mouth or they have them at just go over your nose which one do you have I have both I started because I used the nose one and then I was breathing through my mouth and that's all weird so then I got the big one but after a month with that now I just use the nose one now that pumps  are right what it does is it creates air pressure but just very slight what it's adjustable it adjusts based on your reaction to it and so when you are when you're breathing the air pressure keeps the passages open so it can be anatomical it can be your tongue falling back it I have to do this for me yeah so it keeps the the passage open it's just a slight pressure and  it's really nice because you take a it's like you take a deep breath and it fills your lungs because there's just that little extra push and it's totally quiet like there's all this stigma around it like people think it's really like gross or loud or whatever it's not that much the new machines are great and have a humidifier in them so you can adjust the do you how do you power it up when you're camping and stuff well I've got electrical system in the van and I also have a backup battery a little lithium  that's all you need to power the whole night like that yeah if you don't use the humidifier if you use the humidifier it sucks up more because it's a heating thing is humidifier help yeah it's great because you can adjust it you know like you're in La we're in a desert it's dry so you can turn it up if you're you know I was in Seattle it turn it off doesn't matter so it's just change the way you feel I feel so much better I'm like sleeping through the night I dream again yeah I didn't I mean I feel kind of  of Evangelical about it because you know I know a lot of people have this men and women and there's this weird kind of Shame around it and I'm just trying to be like everything to be shameful yeah fuck it man sleep you gotta sleep it's really important it makes everything better you're like 50 percent more likely to have car accidents if you have sleep oh yeah it'll fuck up your job it'll fight you won't get hard-ons it'll like ruin everything some people it's really bad to and it goes on for years  as in years and years they don't even know about I was on a plane once and there was a guy behind me and I would hear yeah I turned around and I was like oh this poor bastard who's a big guy like very overweight and I mean I was watching this guy lying there with his mouth open like the suffix for a long time and then finally he would jostle and catch some air and he woke up and I said hey man and I said do you know you have sleep apnea he's like what do you mean  and I said okay I might let me tell you what's going on and I showed him my mouthpiece I don't like I have this thing that I have to sleep with because of the long flight were on and I said you gotta go to a doctor get that checked out and he goes okay thanks I go no really yeah you gotta go to a doctor I go this is gonna it'll change your life heart disease like a lot of bad shit can hat also affects people's dietary choices because when you're exhausted like that I know how I am like last night I was tired I came home from The Improv  like one o'clock in the morning I should not have eaten but I was like fuck it and I made a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for one am I definitely shouldn't have had that there's an El Camino and jalapenos Manuel I just felt like peanut butter and jelly ya gotta do it bad choice but when you're tired you make bad choices right Matt make bad dietary choices it's a very very common yeah well people are exhausted and overworked and I think that has to apply to people with sleep apnea yeah when you're always exhausted  stood like throughout the day you're just sucking down coffee and trying to stay awake yeah yeah a dry my dad had it for sure and he never had it treated and yeah maybe that's another reason that I'm sort of Evangelical about it because it's like it's so easy so many of the things that mess up our lives are really hard to address like you know the Litany of things you were talking about board meetings and all that but you know if you can get a good night's sleep for you know a visit to a doctor  and I mean this thing cost 800 bucks for this machine I have yeah changes your whole life your whole life solves the problem you know like that's pretty cool pretty fucking cool some people have a problem with their CPAP machines but maybe it's just the kind they use Joey Diaz changed his life hmm he started using that thing he brings it out guys got a portable unit it brings them on planes yeah brings it everywhere yeah yeah it's great I mean I wish every problem were that easy to solve hmm yeah right no kidding yeah  what else you got there my list bunch of notes of anthropology of the the motherfucker Awards I'd what's that you know about that so my buddy oh the trial and I did it last year we had a so the idea is we're hiking one day in Topanga and we're talking about how he's an environmental activist as well as a big wave surfer Kyle Turman show he's a podcast as well but it has a pocket everybody's got a podcast he's a really good guy he's like one of these he's I think he's 20  he's like super Earnest and he's the kind of guy like you're having a conversation and you mentioned a book and a week later he's like hey I read that book you mentioned it's really good it's like all right all young people should be like you you know yeah he's really like tuna Mart yeah and serious about stuff anyway we were talking about how hard it is to get people to pay attention to environmental issues because it's such a downer you know and I was like man I know all these  medians would be cool if we could find a way to get comedy into the environmental thing and we came up with this idea where we flip everything upside down and we say we have an award ceremony to honor the companies that are doing the most to fuck mother earth and the awards are accepted on behalf of the companies by comedians so we did it last year and it was fucking wild he was so great so the presenters were people like Matt Taibbi  maybe for Rolling Stone and the guy who was the founder of Greenpeace and different environmental people and sort of political people and accepting on behalf of his people like Leo flowers and if you know him Jake Johansson sure Moshe Kasher and Natasha Leggero did this incredible bit where they they were incestuous brother sister couple yeah yeah yeah I think they represented Chase Bank yeah  Brendon Walsh he's fantastic it looks like Dennis Miller there hey does yeah so it was great and we were Tuxedos and we did this whole way to do that at a theater in America theater would would ya yeah it was great and it was it's funded by various people but the nail Newman Foundation Paul Newman's daughter how cool she's a big supporter when you do it again December 3rd cool yeah it's great same place  same place if you're free come except in a won't let me find out I think I'm out of town yeah that's the thing we're lining up like Bryan Callen beautiful yeah he's he wants to do it but it's a lot of working together tonight oh good we worked in where the last night dinner with him a week ago we did two shows last night we're doing two shows tonight he's I like that guy La of them the death is one of my favorite people yeah and he's also real down-to-earth he's a real do please people often ask me  me like I guess I'm like a conduit to people like you and Brian and it's like what do they like in real life that they're they're like they seem to be I don't think you do as many podcasts he does or as many as I do and be somebody else right I don't think too much work holding up the facade I don't think it would work yeah I don't think you could hold up a facade that that long yeah  I don't I mean again everybody varies you very who you are dependent upon the day in the stresses and the inferences and life but I don't know anybody who's full of shit like I don't know anybody who's doing a podcast he's got like a totally different Persona right I bet a lot of those self-help fellas probably they're rocking that that's a that's a full of shit industry yeah you know it's like it's one of those this like there's people that are real self help people that are  doing real work and they're really they really are committed to it and they love it and they really love helping people and then there's other people that find that as like an itch it's a way to get in so a little greased path yeah helps you like  yeah slip on in yeah yeah yeah and it's sometimes it's hard to tell who's who in that were yeah you know that's a weird world it's one of the weirdest Worlds the world of constant motivation we are constantly motivating people and yeah and trying to find some new way to say things already said a thousand times and what's it all boiled down to you know it all boils down to the same simple shit again and again it does variance over possessions forgive yourself and others love yourself and others but  times they can say something that resonates sometimes some people can say something that resonates but those people have to they have to be there has to be something unique about them like their life experiences they have to have accomplished something they have to there's they have to be there has to be some actual meat behind their words and there's a lot of people that are doing it that are just doing it because they're they're not really doing anything else yeah they just do that that's very strange it's very strange because they've tapped into this need  this feeling that people have where they need to be motivated and they need you know they need someone to say positive spiritual things that resonate with them so these people have sort of found that as a way to become popular or famous or instafamous or whatever you know yeah it's like buying a membership to a gym and then never going you know yeah we're what I do sometimes like I love to buy camping gear yeah I don't really can't very much though yeah  but I love camping gear man like high quality tents and shacks and go to Ariana have a grand plan yeah yeah I need steaks I need those little fucking aluminum Stakes if the tents into the dirt dude I'm click yeah the the the spiral one oh yeah really good in Santa's well I got that I got a special Hammer to put them in and then it's got holes that you like hook and pull them up yeah yeah I've used it maybe twice in five years you're lucky yeah  bought one of them fucking what are those things called this little stoves the little propane stoves thing yeah that's on top of it never used it yeah sitting in my I was like I'm going to use this on our next trip but when you know when civilization collapses you got that in the garage let's realization collapses you really want flint and steel and you want some Tinder I mean you can't count on any of that shit because you don't know how to make a lighter so you can't count on leiter's you got to be able to make a fire without  later also when civilization ends you're not going to want to live yeah yeah that's the thing it's just too hard is no way to really prepare for it and I know it's too hard yeah you know to to live I mean I guess if that's all you've ever known if all you've ever known was living in incredibly primitive way and hunting and Gathering you'd be fine with it well hunting and Gathering is easy for hunter-gatherers if you live in a fertile place even if you don't in the Kalahari  he desert cooking San people work roughly 20 hours a week and with we're calling work is hunting and Gathering what do they hunting I guess there are some sorts of antelope rabbits  rats Desert Rat I don't know I haven't spent much time in the Kalahari Desert vegan a rat's there's a fucking crazy article about these monkeys that are eating rats macaque macaque I said macaque monkeys there look at this yeah cock killer rat eating monkey stun scientist and Malaysia II saw that yesterday and I was going to Tweet it but I was like all right I've tweeted too many fucking crazy things today whatever I read  of the really Bonkers that I tweet it but that one like I'm saving this one for tomorrow but look at the size of that goddamn rat and these monkeys are ferocious predators and they thought of these monkeys is being primarily fruit eaters but no they they really favored eating rats and it's holding this goddamn rat down and eating it headfirst the hell of an image fuckin'-a right yeah well you ever been to something yes like a like a sandwich  look at his like the distant look in his eyes like a rat head you ever been in a place with wild monkeys yes yeah Costa Rica the it was weird we were worried so that come right up to the yeah we were staying at this Resort and we one of my kids wanted to feed the monkey and Oreo and my wife is like oh we probably shouldn't it's not good for him  and then I said this is given one fucking Oreo who cares I bet he's already had an Oreo before I forget what the conversation was anyway the monkey takes the Oreo opens it and eats the white frosting I was like that little motherfuckers Delight Oreos he knew exactly what you do he turned it just like everybody does and start scraping off the frosting and looking right at you yeah it was there was different kinds of monkeys to there was a howler monkeys and then those other men there was big monkeys and little monkeys  that's of crazy Place Costa Rica's Wildman crocodiles and shit that was another interesting place of visited the crocodiles are a trip and because we were in a boat and we went on this like sort of tour of this river system and you go on a tour of the river system watching this fucking 15-foot crocodile slide into the water from the bank like fuck and you see the crocodile slides all over the bank's because these Rivers is just filled with crocodiles and so anytime I kid would come anywhere close to the  railing of the bottom like hey let's stay over here let's stay in the middle of the fuck away from the monsters I met this dude long time ago I don't remember where I was but we're sitting around a fire talking about like bizarre experiences we'd had traveling whatever he was from I think New Hampshire and he had a thing like you and Marshall go running every morning he had a thing where he and his dog would go down to the lake and take a swim every every day at dusk after when he got home from work  take the dog for a swim as a black lab I think and  and he went to visit his brother in Florida hey drove down there and his brother was out and when he arrived and it was around dusk and he's like hey let's go first one there's a lake and he jumps in the water with his dog and they're swimming across the lake and hear it it's quiet right and here's this problem  and he's like well I was that it's a weird sound and then he realizes I'm in fucking Florida I'm not in New Hampshire there are alligators here what the fuck am I doing so he turns around and starts swimming back and he's swimming along trying not to panic and the fucking dog goes aren't dogs gone or Croc came up and  took his dog never saw the dog again wow what I could have been him too yeah one of my favorite alligator stories from Florida's there was a high-speed chase got a stolen car and he gets to abridge the cops chasing them guy jumps out of the car jumps off the bridge gets eaten immediately by an alligator literally landed in front of the alligator three alligator snap the only people that often but they definitely will  that's not what I do well the crocodiles ox and alligators are less aggressive than crocodiles and there are crocodiles in Florida but they're much less frequent what's the difference American alligators are smaller animal they have a longer pointy or snout and they have more exposed teeth an alligator has a blunt more rounded face and they they get much larger than American crocodiles American crocodiles are pretty small  All American alligators get pretty fucking big so in Africa do they have Crocs and elegant no Africa is just crocodile just cry yeah much much much they're huge of crocodiles to have Nile crocodile right you see him take those water buffalo and stuff terrifying saltwater crocodiles I thought I'd seen video what you said so I Googled it four different times at least the last couple of years this happened one guy lost his arm two people died the Florida thing getting chased by the cops and ended up getting eaten by now  one time that's fucking Florida man Florida man is so wacky that is the place where all the refugees is in the outcasts they all go to Florida man yeah yeah more than once I'm sure it makes sense we jump in the water man you've risk in it like they don't just because alligators don't eat people as often as crocodiles doing Africa it doesn't mean that they wouldn't they don't have a rule book right I go that's a person shouldn't eat them they don't give a fuck if you're a dog  dog or a person or a kid it was a an alligator ate a baby at Disney World oh I remember that yeah three years ago yeah yeah fucking two-year-old baby playing by the water the alligator just slides up on the bank snatch pulls it right under fuck that fuck that day yeah when I lived in Florida when I was a kid we lived in Gainesville and there was alligators everywhere and I remember one of them snatch them  his dog knows our true Jesus Christ I didn't know they'd kill people's dogs he would see them floating around and they seem so innocuous because they almost always still yeah they very rarely moved there was signs they didn't want you to feed them marshmallows people would throw marshmallows in the alligator to eat marshmallows  and they just don't want you don't because they slow the marshmallows yeah I guess yeah and they would just chew them up and swallow them so people would throw marshmallows at the alligators just to see it but that was back when alligators were endangered this is in the late 70s and they're not endangered anymore in fact they you could kill as many of like you can get it commercial hunting tag for 500 alligators I watched that on that Swamp People show Mercy  it is a show about alligator killers they just kill an alligator's because you know that remark the last Indians to be pacified I hate that phrase then the United States the last tribe to finally give up was the seminal in the Everglades yeah like that after the Apaches and the Sioux and all that yeah because man every time we try weird life yeah fart live in the Everglades the Everglades are another thing that human beings ruined because a white  trash people in Florida because releasing pythons there's literally nothing left alive in the Everglades all the deer missing all the raccoons are missing all the all the marsh hairs gone everything's missing like the scientists and biologists have done these surveys of Wildlife and the difference between like 1980 and 2019 is so unbelievably Stark yeah it's so crazy and it's all those fucking  dorks that want to keep pets and then they release them they release them out there in the wild yeah yeah pythons but it's not just the Everglades right it's I read recently like 30% of all the birds in North America are gone well that's in the last that's house 10 years a lot of that's how scary yeah have you ever seen the numbers how many house cats how many birds house cats kill billions billions in Justin United States but they're cute adorable fuck  fucking the billions though Killers billions of birds like you see like scientists were baffled when they did the actual survey and they found the real numbers they like this can't be real this can't be right billions you have a cat right yeah way to go you had a whole bit in your step yeah camera yeah yeah I like cats I love cats yeah they're they're interesting creatures I had three of them in Spain as fun like they had their own little world you know yeah three of them did what they wanted to do the only bummer is  litter boxes yeah I had him outside gotta have them outside the house in my neighborhood you cannot yeah coyotes ya know Kyle Barcelona owls and coyotes yeah those owls are motherfucker they'll snatch him up just as quick as anything yeah we have big owls out here so if you were going to die from an animal attack what animal would you like to die from you'd like a big cat because they would kill you before they eat you you know yeah a bear  we'll just eat you yeah black bear Ali grizzly bears sometimes you too well they'll fuck you up and anyway this is what I was told when I was in Alaska that you play dead with a Grizzly but never with a black well because some Grizzlies that if they think you're dead they'll kick some dust on you and come back a week later when you're sure Mountain they're like French people they what they wanted to stink you know like old cheese that's not totally true it depends on how hungry they are and whether or not their own  but you are more likely to be attacked by a black bear for predation right friend of mine was attacked recently really yeah he had a he had to shoot a black bear yeah yeah he was he tried to chase it off and he stumbled upon there was a smell he's a Rancher he stumbled upon this smell and the smell was a dead cow and this black bear had been eating this dead cow and he tried to chase the black bear off and the black bear decide to try to go after him and had to wind up  shooting it he had a rifle or pistol I think is a pistol but it was it wouldn't stop it wouldn't leave me alone just trying to scare get the fuck out of here can't go throwing waving his arms yeah wolfed out them then it turned around and came out on from another Direction and then it literally ran up within like 20 feet of them he's like okay we're done here that happened to me with a monkey once really yeah shoot the monkey I didn't know did you feed him a rat I this was in Malaysia I was in a botanical gardens in Penang Malaysia  you actually told this book the story at the beginning of sex at dawn I was with my girlfriend at the time and like your situation in Costa Rica she wanted to give some peanuts to these monkeys these guys at the entrance were selling little bags of peanuts and so she there was this baby monkey hanging by his tail over the trail where we were and she pulled out this bag of peanuts and like you know opened it and that attracted all this attention from other  monkeys and while she was handing a peanut to the baby this other Monkey Jumped out from the bushes lepton her took the bag of peanuts and was gone like in a flash it was so happened so fast she screaming I'm like what the fuck it was just like holy shit we're surrounded by these monkeys are everyone and that's when we realized like all the local people had these big steps and we thought they were walking sticks or something they're like to keep the monkeys away I didn't have a stick so I  like preventive triggered yeah I got like fuck you monkey you know I shouldn't you leave my girl alone he said that like Joe Dirt not into it right and yeah I felt like you know all this testosterone adrenaline and I was lucky and Hulk smash yeah so we you know 20 minutes later we're in this sort of field  and there's a tree in the middle of the field and they're more baby monkeys and by now she's totally forgotten about it she's just like any other cute so I have the peanuts now and she wants to give more peanut so I pull out a bag to give to her in this monkey comes out of the woods sort of a big one and he's like looking at me and I'm just like fuck you dude like I'm three times your size fuck you and he sort of like moves you know sort of does this thing and he's looking at me and there's a branch I picked up the branch and threw it  right kind of like what your buddy's trying to do with this bear like hey get the fuck out of here you know and this monkey just looked at the branch land in front of him and looked up at me and he was like you fucked up and he lept over it and came charging at me with he like these fangs yeah yeah just coming straight at me I went nuts I turned into a monkey I just started going higher  it's like jumping up and down and spraying spit everywhere and he stopped and we're like and he's and my girlfriend screaming and we're like 10 feet away and then he just like backed up like yeah fuck you well hello Primal moment whoa very Primal you didn't plan that know if I'd had a stick it would have been necessary so the moral of the story is Carrie was curious stick when you're on my walk softly and carry a big stick dude I wrap this up  go take a nap yeah I got shit to do give allies to death

we did this one remotely it's one of the rare dealing other time I did a remote podcast I believe there's only one other one and that was with John Anthony West the late great John Anthony West who else John McAfee that's right when he was on the lam run from the fucking fuzz that's right so two times two times T thank you Jamie but this one is  probably more interesting his name is Edward Snowden and he's on the lam as well so please give it up for Ed Snowden  The Joe Rogan Experience and okay that'll just be are very professional you know people are like how do you live and things like that they're taking money from the Russians and of course the answer is no but I do this for a living like I speak I'm I don't have a YouTube channel that where it's you know I'm I'm Joe Rogan but I give speeches at universities and things like that  a lot of interviews and so we're recording now my own setup is it possible that you could do a YouTube channel would that work if ya like I mean if you introduce me so like I get followers yeah we could do that dude I'm all in that that could absolutely happen do you want to do that is it something you want to do no I mean this is a big question so I came on because I had just written a book called permanent record which  is the story of my life because that's what Publishers make you doing when you're writing your first book but it's more than that because I didn't just want to talk about me it's actually about the changing of technology and the changing of government in this sort of post 9/11 era which in our generation just sort of happened to be growing up during and I was at the CIA and the NSA and all this stuff but the day that the book came out the government hit me with a lawsuit and they hit the publisher of the books  they with a lawsuit because they don't want to see books like this get written they especially don't want to see books like this get red and so the big thing was you know we didn't know where this is going we didn't know what was going to happen and my publisher of course wanted me very badly to let people know this book existed in case the government leaned harder and harder and harder we didn't know where where that's going the government is still pursuing that case quite strongly they're more focused on though  the financial censorship side of it basically taking any money that I made from it kind of is a warning to the others and getting a legal judgment against the Publishers saying you know you can't pay this guy that kind of thing more so than taking the book off the shelves but that's not because they're okay with the book being on the shelves it's because thankfully we've got the First Amendment and so they can't and that's very rare and and good thing but anyway in the context of that  they were like well what about Joe Rogan and you know I I had heard about you at this point but you know the only thing that I had really seen that I really understood had familiarity with was like you talking to Bernie Sanders which by the way is very much appreciated hearing them because a lot of people don't give the guy time to talk yeah to hear him in those sound bites you don't really get an understanding of who he actually is right and this is the other thing like they're like well you know you can go on all these  major network shows and I did a couple of them I did like a morning show I did Brian Williams but broadly the media is the the sort of more corporate sized media as we might say is exactly what you just described right they they want you to be able to answer and light heat 15 seconds or less and when we're talking about big massive shifts in society we're talking about power we're talking about technology and how it controls and influences us  in the future you can't have a meaningful conversation within those constraints and so instead these guys all want to say repeat these long discredited sort of criticisms and you know I'm sure you'll ask the same thing and that's okay their fur questions but it's like we can't have the conversation if we can't have this space to think right breathe and have this sort of discussion so anyway they mentioned you and I was like Joe Rogan Joe Rogan Joe Rogan where do I know this name from before  Bernie Sanders and I look back through my my Twitter mentions and the funny thing is your fans have been harassing me to death for like the last year's wonderful people wonderful people but like go on Joe Rogan go on Joe Rogan and I remember like after I had just made a Twitter account Neil deGrasse Tyson actually I helped me get on Twitter gave me that little initial boost and they said Joe Rogan and so  like link you and you know I Mouse over your name because I use a desktop mobile for this because security reasons and it pops up and I get your avatar man and like I have to say your logo is the worst thing in the world for people who are like trying to be like politically serious and you know they're worried about the National Security advisor condemning because like this bald guy with this maniacal grin like the third eye on his forehead and I'm like oh man that's show you know that that doesn't look good but it's actually like  do you watch you know when you watch what you're doing is it's great stuff man it's great but that first impression like I this almost didn't happen but everybody who has talked to you you know everybody who watches your show I think they get a very different impression than how your paint and for me it's a wonderful thing because nobody understands that better than I do right like the government ran a smear campaign against me endlessly for six months when I came forward in June of 2013 I know we got way off topic here I'll get  to it fun there's no such thing as my topic we could do okay talk about whatever great great okay so for those people first off who have no idea who the hell I am I'm the guy who's behind the revelations of global Mass surveillance in 2013 I worked for the CIA I worked for the NSA as a contractor at the NSA staff officer the CIA I was undercover working at embassies but and I talked about the  France between this in a book and contractor and government official and how it's all sort of lost its meaning but I saw something wrong and I saw basically the government was violating the law and what I believe to be the Constitution of the United States and more broadly human rights for everyone in the United States and around the world there were domestic surveillance programs that were Mass surveillance programs so that worked internationally basically everything that they could monitor they were monitoring and this is actually like people go  obvious isn't that what they're supposed to do and this is weird but the answer actually is no under the framework of our constitution the government was only supposed to be monitoring people that it has an individualized particularized suspicion of wrongdoing for right this is we think about this in the investigative means right like all those TV shows where they're like go and get a warrant the reason they have to do that like we fought hey it Revolution over this you know a couple hundred years back  is the idea that when we had you know Kings when we had governments have absolute power they could simply go in your home and go you know he's this guy pot smoker get his diary you know whatever it is and just like if you find evidence of crime you mark them off to prison and it's all good you found evidence their criminal where you didn't find evidence well no harm no foul you're just doing what government does  we were trying to build a better system where it went yes the governor has extraordinary capabilities but it only uses them where they're necessary right where their proportionate to the threat that is presented by this person you know like we shouldn't be afraid of the person who's got like a baggie of weed in their dresser or something like that that is not a threat to National Security that is not a threat to Public Safety but what happened in the wake of 9/11 was a whole  of government officials got together behind closed doors and this was actually LED interestingly Enough by the Vice President of the United States Cheney everybody remembers that name or hopefully I can look that name up Dick Cheney and his personal attorney sort of the the Giuliani of Dick Cheney a guy named David Addington and this lawyer David Addington wrote a secret legal interpretation that no one  else was allowed to see it was kept in the vice president safe at the White House they weren't giving this even when they told people and it was just a couple people in Congress Nancy Pelosi was one of them on a couple of these other folks when they talked to the heads of the agency the NSA and the CIA and the FBI and all this stuff they told them the White House and the office of legal counsel and you know this this the president's attorneys all of these guys had decided this would be legal  do but we can't tell you why we can't show you the legal authorization for you just got to take our word for it and so they did this and this became a mass surveillance program called Stellar Wind which they said was supposed to monitor the phone calls and internet communications emails and things like that have everybody in the United States and around the world who they could get access to for links to Al-Qaeda because if you remember in the wake of the September 11th attacks they were singing  Ying  we thought there could be sleeper cells of Al Qaeda that we just you know peppered all throughout the country they're going to spring up at any moment of course light weapons of mass destruction it just didn't exist it was all a power grab but on that basis they started doing this in secret and it was completely unconstitutional was completely illegal even under the very loose requirements of the Patriot Act but they did it for so long that they got comfortable with them they thought this is the you know this is a really powerful capability what if we started using this  stuff that was other than terrorism because it wasn't finding any terrorists because there weren't any terrorists in this context of that we're looking for them and the ones who where there were terrorists the program wasn't affected because these were guys in Pakistan that weren't using you know email and phone calls they were getting on a moped with their cousin who was a courier who's bringing a letter to his guy you know who runs the the food stand or whatever but bit by bit over time this grew and  grew and grew and there were scandals and if you want to drill down in these later I'll go into them but what happened was step by step by step our constitutional rights were changed and we weren't allowed to know it we were never granted a vote on it and even the many members of Congress right 535 in the United States they were prohibited from knowing this and instead they told only a few select people in the original case there were only eight members of  Congress called the gang of eight who knew about this then there were the people on the intelligence committees both in the Senate and the house who were told about this but they were only told partially about it they weren't told the full scope of it and now that they have been told about it because they had security clearances and things like that they weren't allowed to tell anybody else even if they objected to it and we had one Senator Ron Wyden and another one I believe Tom Udall was named of them who did object to this and who wanted something to happen but because  because they couldn't tell anybody that was happening they were sort of doing these weird Lassie barks to the Press where they were like we have grave concerns about the way these programs have been carried out but nobody knew what they were talking about and so journalists were like you know they've got concerns what does that last see what are you trying to say Timmy's in the well but they were getting it wrong they couldn't tell what was happening so what had happened was that we the American people and sort of lost our seat at the table of government we were no longer partner to government we had simply become  jet government I think everybody who's in the world today who is aware of what's going on whether it's under this Administration last Administration the one before that right they have seen a constant kind of shift where we have we the public have less say in less influence over the policy of government with each passing year there's kind of a new class that's being created a government class and then the the  Eric civil class that are held to different standards of behavior and when we start talking about leaking and whistleblowing this becomes even more clear and so what I did was I wanted to clarify that kind of Lassie Mark right I just wanted everybody to know what was going on I didn't want to say the government can't do this I didn't want to say this is how you guys have to live because that's not for me to say but I do believe that everybody in the United States and more broadly people in the world who are having the rights violated by a  rent should have at least an understanding how that is happening what the authorities sort of the policies and programs that are enabling that or so that they can protest them so that they can cast a vote about them who so that they can say you know what you guys say this is okay but I disagree that this is not okay I object and I want things to change and so I gathered evidence of what I believe to be a criminal or unconstitutional activity in the part of the government and I gave this to churn  lists right now I gave this to journalists under a very strict condition here which was that they publish no story in this Archive of information simply because it was interesting right no clickbait not anything just because they thought it would make news that would get them Awards they would only publish stories that they were willing to make an Institutional judgment and stand behind and this was three different newspapers that it was in the public interest to know  and so then beyond that there was additional is because if you could see sort of what I was doing here what had happened what had led us into this Pitfall was that  the system of checks and balances that supposed to self-regulate our government had failed the courts had abdicated their role in policing the executive and the Congress because terrorism was such a hot argument at the time they were worried about being criticized and blamed if something went wrong and attack did go through and they didn't have access to the information that the programs were ineffective so they were just taking the government's word for it they didn't want to wait him Congress most of them didn't even know right  and the ones who did know it was the same thing they were getting their pockets stuffed with money by the defense contractors that were getting rich for building these systems that were violating the rights of each of us so they benefited by just saying nothing and then the executive themselves whether we're talking about Bush right whether we're talking about Obama or whether we're talking about Trump now all these guys were okay with a constantly growing surveillance State because they're the ones whose hands were on the lever at the time they got to aim it they got to use it  if you had a little search box in front of you they would give you the email history and you know of everybody in the United States anybody want if you could pull up their text messages anybody you want you can see anything they've ever typed into that Google search box right Joe what is the worst thing you've ever typed into that search box that lasts forever right and they have a record of that they can get that from Google and so this was this was the whole thing how do we correct for that so when you have somebody  who wants to inform the public of something and we'll get in the proper channels arguments later but you can't go through the institution to get these corrected because the institution knows it's wrong in his doing anyway right that's the whole origin of the program is they want to do something that they're not allowed to do what do you do right and so I didn't want to say I'm the president of Secrets I didn't want to just put this stuff on the internet and I could have on the technologist right  I worked with the journalists and then to create an adversarial step right someone who would argue against what I believed and hopefully with the journalists believe once they consulted the documents and basically authenticated them can we get the government to play that role right now and so before the journal is published any story this is a controversial think people still criticize me for this actually they say I was to accommodate in government they could be right  is that the journalist would go to the government and give them warning say we're about to run this story about this secret program that says you did X Y & Z bad thing one is that right and the government always go oh no comment right to is this going to cause harm is anybody going to get hurt is this program effective is there something we don't understand right is this something Snowden doesn't understand it is this guy just not get it right are these documents fake whatever you want say we shouldn't run this  sorry in every case I'm aware of that process was followed and that's why right was because there's a lot of people out there who don't like me who criticized me who go this poisson safe this caused harm to people or whatever we're in 2019 now I came forward and these stories won the Pulitzer Prize for public service journalism starting way back in June of 2013 we've had six years to show bodies we've had six years to show harm and you know  know as well as I do the gums happy to leak things when it's in their interest nobody has been hurt as a result of these disclosures because everyone who was involved in them was so careful we wanted to maximize the public benefit while mitigating the potential risks and I think we did a pretty good job of but just to get back to the the main thing the original thing that got us off on that trail when I came forward in June of 2013 I gave one interview to the people who were in  the room with the documents Laura poitras Glenn Greenwald Ewen MacAskill and I said who I was I said why I was doing this I said what this was about why it matters and then we were constructing a system of TurnKey tyranny and even if you trust that to Obama you never know whose hand is going to be on that key next and all I have to do is turn it and there's nothing we can do to stop it the only thing this restraining these programs really is policy more so than the law and the president anytime can sign an  napkin and those policies change  well after that I went six months without giving any interviews because I didn't want people to talk about me I want to do them to talk about what actually matters in the government of course was trying very hard to change the conversation as they always do to be about who is this guy what are they done right what's wrong with them what are their problems who is this this loony guy so they can controversial eyes the source of a story rather than having to confront the story itself and that's why  I said it's I really kind of appreciate  your take on the media and everything like that because  when you don't tell your story you know other people will tell it for you they'll say so many things about you and they'll have these misimpressions like I did because of something as stupid as the Avatar that you're using on Twitter right where I think it's a certain kind of show with a certain kind of guy and it's this crazy stuff but when I actually listen to you when I actually look at the facts right and when I hear you just speak I go actually this is a thoughtful guy actually this is somebody who does care who does want to look at these things deeply  appearances at our first impressions can be very misleading I work hard on that I try to mislead people it's good works to my advantage in a good job man thank you I want to bring it back to when you first started with the NSA you started as a contractor right what was your initial impression and when did you know that things were really squirrelly  with the program's there is something so I'm not saying this to put put you on the spot I know you've been a busy guy I know you had it done I think shows recently you come back from break right but have you read the book because it'll just help me put your buffering if you haven't got a chance to you know I don't know I have not read your book or got a copy of it okay well I will send you a signed copy brother beautiful died I hope you'll read it and I hope you enjoy it but all right so I had a  really weird history in the intelligence Community I grew up in a federal family in the shadow for me write all these little Suburban communities in Maryland where basically the entire industry the state is the federal government of all these different agencies and then all the subcontractors all the defense industries that serve that government and really are kind of our war making machine our system of control for the country and the world broadly all that stuff  it spreads and you know a couple hundred mile radius out of DC a my mother worked for the district courts rather the federal courts and it's kind of funny because she still works there and those are the courts that are trying to throw me in jail for the rest of my life now my father worked for the Coast Guard retired after 30 years my grandfather was an admiral and then he worked for the FBI as far back as it goes my my family  my whole line of family even Generations back was working for the government so it was pretty ordinary pretty expected for me to go into the same kind of work now I started and I wasn't super successful in school because  it I felt and you know this is the most arrogant thing in the world than anybody says  that I had more to learn from computers than I did from you know biology class and so I spent more and more time focusing on technology than I got mono and I dropped out of high school and now it's like all right how do I make this up I said drop out of high school but I'm actually going to community college right they called it concurrent enrollment where I'm not taking any classes at high school I'm going to community college instead  and I'm not doing that great there either like it's fine you know I'm enjoying it but you know school is school I want I can't wait to be grown you're bored and I think a lot of people have felt that but I ran into somebody at the community college who ran their own home based business doing web design and they could see I was kind of Technical and they went Haiti want to work for me and I was like well that sounds  eight and so I started doing web design really really early on this is like gosh I don't know probably 1998 vintage during the big boom and then the collapse the followed and the funny thing is she worked she was married to an NSA analyst a linguist right and so she lived on Fort Meade and she ran her business out of their home on Fort Meade  that's right up the street from the NSA so before I'm even working there I'm driving past this building all the time and trying to figure out you know what the next step is going to be and I enjoy this it's a good thing for me and I like it it works well and I start getting trained and certified all these little industry stamps you've got to get as a technologist to say oh you know this program or whatever and just start climbing the ladder  but then 9/11 happens and I'm on Fort Meade when 9/11 happens I'm just going into work and I tell this in the book in some detail and I think it's very much worth reading for people don't know this because this is forgotten history that how old were you at this buddy Josh I was I was born in 83 so I was probably 18 years old and  yeah yeah and I just turned 18 a couple months before  and what people forget is who knew what was going on before anybody else on September 11th the intelligence Community right and what did they do right did they give out a public mourning today tell you guys to evacuate did they say do this after that no no not for everybody not for long time  but at the NSA then director Michael Hayden he was a general he later became a director of the CIA ordered the entire campus evacuated of thousands tens of thousands of people actually just said go home right the CIA did the same thing they were running on skeleton Crews at the moment the country needed them more than they ever had right and  I get a call well not hear her call that's from my boss's wife her husband to her he's calling from the NSA saying hey you know I think Edge should leave for the day because I'm the only employee this business besides her because I think they're going to close the base down I'm like this is crazy that never closes down I we don't know what's happening then we start checking the news which is through websites right because we're doing all this stuff and suddenly it's the big story everywhere  and you know nobody understands how big it is yet most of us are like oh it's going to mess with our workday oh it's going to mess with our commute but when I'm leaving  I hear car horns all over the base it's the craziest thing because this is a military base right it's right outside the NSA and I enter just this absolute state of pandemonium as I go past canine road which is the road that travels right and Pat it in front of the nsa's headquarters and it's just a parking lot as far as you can see they have military police out under the stoplights directing traffic because it's this Mass evacuation and I still have no idea what's happening like the  are you still developing but I will never forget that image  why did these people have so much power and so much money and so much Authority at that if at the moments we need them the most they're the first ones in the country that are leaving their buildings  and you know later on they said and this is a covered in book I believe I think it's James Bamford who interviewed that director of NSA gave that order now about what was happening he was going well you know he called his wife and he was asking where their kids were and everything like that and then after that he wanted to think about well where could these other planes that they knew were in the air today  and struck it where could they be headed  and this sort of shows how self-centered the intelligence Community is this is the DC Metro area right thinking at the White House they get it Congress they get it the Supreme Court right and they go They're going to fly their planes into the CIA headquarters oh they're going to fly their planes into the NSA headquarters and of course it was never realistic that these would be the targets but on that basis they were like ooh let's get our bacon out of the  but now I don't say this I'm sorry but go ahead and just in the interest of what wasn't it possible that they could have attacked those places mean they attacked the Pentagon they you know they knew that there isn't a cab look it's absolutely possible they could have attacked your Denny's right you know but it's a question of risk assessment if you have planes in the air if you believe there's an ongoing terrorist attack it's happening in the United States  right now and if you have built History's Greatest surveillance agencies right that the most powerful intelligence forces in the history of the species you got are going to take those off the board or at least the majority of their personnel off the board then in a chance that you have no sort of grounds for substantiating that they could be targeting you to begin with simply because they could well somebody else  we'll get hit with those as you say it's going to be the Pentagon right it's going to be the World Trade Center it's going to be someone somewhere and the more minutes you're in front of that desk the higher the chances even if it's a very small chance even if it's somebody who doesn't work on terrorism right maybe if it's somebody who normally works Finance in North Korea right but they go look this is emergency everybody understands you don't need to explain this you just go stop what you're doing look at Financial transactions related to who  these plane tickets do this you just go full spectrum and go anything you can do right now if the building gets hit we get hit that's what we signed up for nobody wants that right that that's not the desired outcome but  if they had asked the staff to do that they all would have agreed that's what these people signed up to do and yet the director goes no you know we're just just know like we're not going to take that right and this is I think it's says so much about the bureaucratic character of how government works right the people who rise to the top of these governments  it's about risk management for them right it's about never being criticized for something in this is look if we want to get really controversial in this is something that'll that'll haunt me because people will bring it up again and again and again people ask about you know people still criticize me and the book you know I talked about aliens and chemtrails and things like that in the fact there there's no evidence for that I went looking on the network right and I know Joe I I know  you want there to be aliens I do I know Neil deGrasse Tyson badly wants there to be aliens and there probably are right but the idea that we're hiding them if we are hiding them I had ridiculous access to the networks of the NSA the CIA the military all these groups I couldn't find anything right so if it's hidden and it could be hidden it's hidden really damn well even from people who are on the inside but the main thing is conspiracy theory  he's right everybody wants to believe in conspiracy theories because it helps life make sense it helps us believe that somebody has control in control right that somebody is calling the shots these things all happen for a reason this that and the other  there are real conspiracies but they're not typically you know that they've got tens of thousands of people working on them unless you're talking about the existence of the intelligence Community itself which is basically constructed on the idea that you can get I think there's four million or 1.4 million people in the United States who hold security clearances  and you can get all of these people to not talk ever the journalists are this that or the other but when you look back at the 9/11 report and when you look back at the history of what actually happened what we can prove right not what we can speculate on but what are at least the commonly agreed facts  it's very clear to me as someone who worked in the intelligence Community not during this period of course I was too young but very shortly thereafter that these attacks could have been prevented and in fact the government says this too but the government goes the reason that they these attacks happened the reason that they weren't prevented is what they call stovepiping right there was there was not enough sharing they needed to break down the walls and the  teams that were chaining these poor Patriots at the NSA and the CIA and the FBI from all working on the same team and to some extent their correct on this right there there were limits on the way agencies were supposed to play ball with each other but I worked there and I know how much of this is bullshit and how much is this is not those are procedural and policy limits in some cases legal limits on what can be shared without following a process without doing this that or the other without  basically asking for permission without getting a sign off or anything like that if the FBI wanted to send absolutely everything they had to the CIA they could have done so at the CIA wanted to send everything they had the FBI they could have done so they didn't and people died as a result now government goes bureaucratic procedures realism was responsible and it's because we had too many restrictions on the intelligence community and this is what led to the world post 9/11 where all of our right sort of evaporated was they went well restrictions on  these agencies can do are costing lives therefore naturally we just have to unchain these guys and everything will be better right and if you remember that post 9/11 moment you can understand how that actually could come off as persuasive how that might be a kind of thing to go you go alright well well that makes sense because everybody was terrified right there were people quite quickly who got their heads back on their shoulders the right way there were some of them who never lost their heads at all  and who protested the Iraq War at the same time I don't self was signing up to go fight it volunteering for the Army and we'll get into that in a minute but  everything that has followed in the decades passed came from the fact that in a moment of fear we lost our heads and we abandon all the traditional constitutional restraints that we put on these agencies and we abandon all of the traditional political restraints and just social constraints idiot logical systems of belief about the limitations that the secret police should have  free and open society and we won't look you know terrorists we created shows like 24 and Jack Bauer where he's like threatening knife people's eyeballs out if they won't tell them this that or the other and we entered this era of increasingly unlimited government as a result and now in hindsight we go we should have been surprised but at the time everyone everyone panicked right but if you go back to did that help and we know the answer  now is in fact no it did not it made things worse I don't think any historians going to look at the Bush Administration and go this improved the position of the United States in the world but if you go back you don't win back the tape to that pre 9/11 moment wind back the tapes those silos and those walls that they said needed to come down because that was restraining government instead of the rules that said well you can share these things but there's got to be basis there's got to be a justification you've got to go why are  treating people's information like baseball cards and all of this stuff it's super easy as an intelligence officer to justify sharing information about a suspected terrorist who you think is planning to kill people or is even just in a country they shouldn't be replaced they shouldn't be doing something you don't think they should be with another agency because no one's going to question that a judge is going to question that any judge in the world will stamp that war without even thinking about it and go to bed that night you  without a care in the world because it's you're not spying on a journalist you know spying on human rights Defender right this is not an edge case this is someone that you believed to be associated with al-qaida or whatever now this is all a lot of preamble to say that essential fact government agrees everyone agrees detects probably could have been prevented if information has been shared so why wasn't the information shared government says information wasn't shared  because of these restrictions and it's half true because every important lie has some kernel truth to it and there were these barriers but the reality is why would those barriers respected in the case of a major terrorist plot why wasn't the CIA sharing information with the FBI why was the FBI sharing information with the NSA why because the NSA sharing information with the CIA in the case of marriage major terrorist plot  and if you've worked in government if you worked in the intelligence Community if you work in any large institution you know if you work at a company that sells batteries you know that every office is fighting the other office for budget for cloud for promotions and this is the sad reality of what actually happened every one of those agencies wanted to be the guy who busts the plot they wanted to be the one who got credit for it and they didn't realize how serious it was  is until it was too late because they were competing with each other rather than cooperating with that's exactly what I was going to ask you if that was the issue the competition between these agencies because they are very proud of the CIA accomplishing something or the FBI accomplishing something and they want to be the one to take credit for that yeah I don't mean I think it's important like in their defense because nobody else here is going to provide a defense for them is that that's  actually Darkly human again this happens in every industry this happens in every sort of big corporate thing because you want to get promoted and you know everybody's putting in there like achievements at the end of the year for what they did and if you're the guy who does that you're going straight to the top but their solution instead of just the the so we have a weird delayer for folks that are listening kind the so their solution instead of having someone be responsible for Bridging the Gap and providing that information to each individual agency  see their solution was mass surveillance  well no they're different things this is 911 is what woke these guys up right basically and they went well we screwed up and Americans died as result we really don't want to take the hit on it and to be honest the government had no interest in putting the hit on them to be honest the public had no interest in putting the hit on them at the time because everybody understood terrorism is a real thing  there are bad people in the world and that's true right that will always be true there's always going to be criminals there's always going to be terrorists whether they're at your church whether they're across the ocean there are people out there who are angry their disenfranchised their violent and they just want to harm something they want to change something even in a negative way because that's what they feel  is all they have left which these are criminals right these are people that we don't need to pity but if we ever want to stop it we do need to understand it and where those things come from where there's this drives come from the first place but basically everybody went all right how do we stop this because nobody wants to feel unsafe nobody wants to feel like the building's going to come down the next time you go in it and so everybody just went I don't care who does it stop it  and they said this to Dick Cheney which is a historic mistake because date Dick Cheney knows how government works he was the person in that white house who was best placed to know all the levers of government all the interagency cooperation where we were strong where were weak what we could do what we were not allowed to do and what he did was he took that little dial on what we're not allowed to do and he changed it all the way until it broke and snapped off and then there was nothing that we  couldn't do anymore and you were there why this is happening this was this know I was I who I was not again this is 2001 I was I was 18 years old I was working on the base I drove past a building that was it this is all hindsight this biography this is documented history but this is not you know the gospel of Edward Snowden II don't know this right this is public record this has been what we all know  what we have though the reason that I bring this up is this is a teachable moment because there's so many people right now in the Trump Administration who go look this guy has too much power he's abusing it against immigrants he's abusing it against domestic ponens he's doing whatever he's trying to hurt political rivals in the next election all of this stuff and you know we can get into the stuff later if you want in detail but the bottom line is they're going this is a guy who's in the White House who's throwing elbows right he doesn't really  he wants to hurt people as long as he can convince the Americans that those are the bad guys right that's the enemy doesn't matter if they're far away it doesn't matter if they're closed at home whoever he's against he's going to harm and the dark thing is this is actually why he was elected in moments of fear where the world starts falling apart and this happens in authoritarian country after country this is why you have Vladimir Putin in Russia who's been  are for 20 years right present for basically 20 years think about that you know he sort of skipped in the middle there because he had to dodge the fact that presidents can only serve somebody can second term so we drop down the Prime Minister and they came back as president but I think about that how do you get that kind of political longevity and it's because if you know anything about Russian history which you know even I don't know that much about the 90s after the collapse of the Soviet Union were an extraordinarily dark time  if you look at Russian Cinema all they had were gangster movies right all they had were the disintegration of society how things are dark and broken no one trusts each other pensions were no longer being paid Social Security is not there anymore like there's nothing to buy there's nothing to do there's no job no one had a future and so they went if there's somebody who can lead us out of this if there's somebody who will fix this who will find us an enemy in defeat that enemy to restore Prosperity will put them in office we see it happened in turkey with erdem on  right we've seen it happen successively with bad governments even in Western democracies we see it happening sadly in places like Poland and Hungary you can even argue it's happening in the United Kingdom right and now there are a lot of people arguing that's exactly what we're seeing with Donald Trump's White House in the United States and this is the lesson that we didn't learn from 2001  is when we become fearful we become vulnerable right to anyone who promises they will make things better even if they have no ability to make things better even if they will actively make things worse even if they will make things better for themselves and their bodies by taking from you but if they tell you that they'll make things better and you believed them in a moment of fear that typically leads to unfortunate outcomes so sorry let me let me turn this  back over to you because we got Way Off Track there no that's all right I want to bring it back to the initial question so you're working for the NSA when do you realize there's a huge issue and when do you feel this responsibility to let the American people know about this issue like when when do you contact these journalists and what was the thought process regarding this like what what steps did you go through once you realize that this was in violation of the Constitution and that even with the laws of the Patriot Act and the Patriot Act two things had changed  so radically that you knew this was wrong and you had to do something about it you felt a responsibility to speak out okay so since we gave so much historical Preamble let me just give the cliff notes version can to get us up to that so after September 11th I'm a little bit lost I'm doing my technical stuff but it doesn't really feel like it matters anymore like I'm making more money I'm becoming more accomplished but the worlds on fire right you remember there was a crazy mood  patriotism in the country because we were all trying to come together get through it you remember like people were sticking Dixie cups in the top of every chain link fence on every overpass there's like stand together you know never forget United We Stand flags on every car exactly and you know I was a young young guy who is not especially political right and I come from a military background I you Federal family all that stuff and so that means I'm very vulnerable to this kind of stuff I  I see it on the news and Bush and all his sort of cronies are going look it's Al-Qaeda it's terrorism terrorist organization they have all these International connections there's Iraq you know dictators weapons of mass destruction there holding the world of Ransom you got colon Powell at the UN dangling little vials of like fake Anthrax and so I felt an obligation to do my part and so I volunteered to join the Army you probably can't tell from looking at me but I'm not going to  at the top of the MMA circuit anytime soon so it didn't work out I joined a special program on those called the 18 x-ray program where they take you in off the street and they actually give you a shot at becoming a special forces Soldier so you train harder and special platoons you go further and I ended up breaking my legs basically so they put me out old discharge yeah it was basically what it was they were shin splints that I was too dumb to get off of right  that's why I kept marching underweight I'm a pretty light guy to begin with I had a 24-inch waist when I when I joined the army girls are jealous my way I think I weighed like a hundred and twenty eight pounds I got I was in great shape you know in boot camp because I came up really quick because it was a you know all I could do is gain but it was it was just too much on my frame because I wasn't that that active and so when you keep  hang on a stress injury right and you running underweight with like rucksacks and things like that you're running in like boots and then you're doing an exercise in the Army's like a whole chapter in the book you got your battle buddy right because they never allow you to be alone it was going to have somebody watching you they thought it was funny to put me the smallest guy in the platoon the drill sergeants did with the biggest dude in the platoon who is like an amateur bodybuilders like you know 230 or 260 something like that he was a big fella  mmm and so you know he would when we're off in the woods doing these these marches and things like that we have to practice buddy carries like the fireman's carry and things like that he throws me around his neck you know I'm like a towel he's just skipping down like it's nothing and then I got to put him on me and I'm just like oh God dying it was it was it was weirdly fun I enjoyed it but it was no good for my body and so the Land Navigation movement I step off a log because I was on point and on the other  side of the law because it's the woods and George on its and he'll I see a snake and so in my memory you know it's like time slows down because North Carolina you know where I grew up you think all snakes are poisonous  sorry this is the Rishi do we know we're good we're good it's completely fun no we're fine all right there was something that happened on the screen I wanted to make sure it was okay now that's just selfish I joining the chat that's what I was worried about second yeah it's opened up here yeah so anyway I try to take a much longer step in midair I'll and badly and it's just one leg is like fire I'm limping them live in the Libyan but you know everybody says don't go to sick call  to go to sick call you may lose your slot you'll end up General infantry or regular infantry so I go back I just tough it out I get my rack in the next morning when I get out of the rack which is the the top bunk bed right I jumped in my legs they just give out underneath me and I try to get up and I just can't get up and so I go to sick call and I end up going to the hospital and they end up X-ray and me and they also x-ray my battle buddy because I got to go there was somebody else  he has a broken hip where they had to bring him to surgery and it's in the book there's a lot more detail about it was kind of dramatic moment but for me they just said I had by lateral tibial fracture is right all the way up my legs they said I had spider webs and the next frame phase of the training was jump school right where you gotta jump out of a plane and the doctor you know what it's like  son if you jump on those legs they're going to turn into powder and he's like I can hold you back you know we can put you for like 6 months you stay off them then you can go back through through the whole cycle right start basic from scratch but you'll lose your slot in the Special Forces pipeline because of the way these things are scheduled and everything like that and then you'll basically be re-signed to the needs of the army or  which probably meant I was going back to i t which was what I joined the army to kind of Escape or you can go out on this special kind of discharge that's called an administrative discharge right normally got honorable discharge dishonorable discharge things like that this is something for people who have been in for I think less than six months where it's like a mailing a marriage it's as if it never happened is as if you never joined and at the time I was like well you know that's very kind of him  to do that and I took it you know they sent me to sick call or sort of the Sick Bay where you're like the medical platoon and you do nothing for it was I think about a month and then they let you out once the paperwork all finishes but in hindsight I realized that if you take it administrative discharge it exempts the Army for liability for your injuries so actually what I thought was a  kindness was just you know now if I had future problems with my legs they wouldn't have to cover it or health insurance and any of those things and it was it was just a funny thing but anyway I get out of the army and here  I'm on crutches for a long time and just sort of trying to figure out all right well what's next in life because I had gotten a basic security clearance just for going through signing up for the military process I applied for a security guard position at the University of Maryland because it said you had to get a top secret clearance which is what a higher clearance than I had at a time  and I went well that sounds good because I knew if I combine my it skills which for now suddenly much more relevant again to my future with the top secret security clearance because of the way it works if you have a top secret security clearance and Tech skills you get paid a ridiculous amount of money for doing very little work so I was like all right well you know I can basically make twice what I would be making in the private sector working for government at this level at the space because what we talked about earlier with September 11th and how the  Community change they no longer cared that I hadn't graduated from college right and I had gotten a GED just by going in and taking a test so for government purposes it was the same as if I was a high school graduate so now suddenly it was like these these doors are open now this University of Maryland facility turned out to be an NSA facility it was called a castle the center for the advanced study language thinking  diversity of Maryland College Park and all I was was literally a security guy walking around with with a walkie-talkie making sure nobody breaks in at night managing the electronic alarm system and things like that but once I had my foot in the door there I could start climbing the ladder step by step and I applied for I went to a job fair actually that was only for people who had security clearances  and I ended up going to the table for one of the technical companies it was a little tiny subcontractor nobody's ever heard of and they said you know we've got tons of positions for somebody like you are you comfortable working nights and I was like yeah you know I wake up in the middle of the day anyway that's fine with me and suddenly I've gone from working for the NSA through a university in a weird way where it's like the NSA holds the clear  but I'm formally an employee of the state of Maryland at the college and this is government man it's all these weird Dodges and boondoggles for how people are employed there now suddenly I'm working at CIA headquarters right the place where all the movie show you swoop over the marble seal and everything like that I'm the king of the castle right and they're at the middle of the night when no one else is there the lights are on motion sensors it's the creepiest thing in the world there's like flags on the wall  all that are just like gently billowing in the air conditioning like ghosts the hallway lights up as you walk alongside it because it's like a green building and they disappear behind you and there's there's no one there I can go down to the gym at like 2 o'clock in the morning at the CIA and it's like not see a soul on the other side of the building then go all the way back and this kind of thing was was my end because they were like look it's the night shift nothing that bad  is going to happen but it was on a very senior technical team that was basically Handling Systems Administration for everybody in the Washington metropolitan area right so every basically CIA server this is a computer system that like data is stored on the reporting is stored on the traffic is moved on all of this stuff suddenly me this is a  AA 2005 I think I'm in charge of and it's just me and one other guy on the night shift and if you're interested in the book there's a lot of detail on this but I get sort of scouted from this position because they realize I actually know a lot about technology they were expecting me just basically make sure the building doesn't burn down all these systems don't go down overnight and they never come back up  but they go well are you willing to go overseas and to a young man at that age that's actually like hey that sounds kind of exciting you know who doesn't want to go work overseas for the CIA and there's a lot of people listening to podcast were like not me I'm going to be lightweight the cia's the bad guys right yeah exactly they're like what are you gonna go overthrow a government somewhere but you have to understand that I'm still very much a True Believer  the government is like delivering compressed embodiment of Truth and goodness and light you know The Shining City on the hill so I want to do my part to spread that to the world I didn't have skepticism is really what I'm trying to establish here  and so I sign up and I go through this special training school like people here in movies about the farm which is down at Camp Peary in Virginia I'm sent to this actually much more secret facility called the hill which is in Warrenton Virginia and this is a been covered a few times and open source media but I think this is one of the few book-length discussions of what happens there in  in permanent record but yeah so I go through training and then I get assigned overseas and I end up in Geneva Switzerland undercover as a diplomat right I think I'm my formal title for the embassy is like something super Bland like diplomatic attache and what I am as I move forward deployed Tech Guy they send you through the school to make you into kind of a MacGyver right yes you can handle all the computers but you can also have  the connections for the embassies Power Systems write the actual electrical connections you can handle the HVAC systems right you can handle locks and alarms and security systems basically anything that's got an on button on it at the embassy that's secure now you're responsible for and I traveled from Geneva to other countries in Europe for sort of assignments and it was like it was an exciting  Ting time I actually still enjoyed it but this was where I first working with intelligence started to get doubts and the story's been told many times so I won't go over and full detail here but the CIA does primarily it's not the only thing they do what's called human intelligence now there are many different types of intelligence the intelligence community's  before the primary ones are human intelligence and signals intelligence you want to think of signals intelligence right as tapping lines hacking computers all of these sort of things that provide electronic information on anything that's digital or analog signal that can be intercepted then turned into information human intelligence is you know all that fun stuff we've heard the CIA doing for decades and decades which  is where they try to turn people basically they say look we'll give you money if you sell out your country they don't it's not even your country a lot of times it's your like organization these guys could be working for a telecommunications provider and they want to sell customer records or they work at a bank which was the thing that I saw and we wanted records on the bank's customers so we wanted a guy on the inside but anyway that that's sort of how it works and what I saw was they were way more aggressive  for the lowest Stakes than was reasonable responsible they were totally willing to destroy somebody's life just on the off chance they would get some information that would that wouldn't even be a tremendously valuable and so you know ethically that that struck me as a bit off but I let it pass because what I what I've learned over my life short though it's  Ben you know  it is that skepticism is something that needs to build up over time it's a skill something that needs to be practiced or you can think of it as something that you develop through exposure I kind of like radiation poisoning but in a positive way it's when you start to realize  inconsistencies or hypocrisies wardlaw it's and you notice them and you know you give somebody the benefit of the doubt or you trust them or you think it's alright but then over time you see it's not an isolated instance it's a pattern behavior and over time that exposure to in consistency builds and builds and builds until it's something that you can no longer ignore now after the CIA I went to the NSA  in Japan where I was working there in Tokyo and then from there a couple years later I went to the CIA again now I was working as private employee for Dell but I was the senior technical official on Dells sales accounts the CIA you know people these big companies they have sales accounts to the CIA and so this means I'm going in and now it's crazy because I'm still a very young man but I'm sitting across the table from Chiefs of these enormous CIA  since I'm sitting across from their Chief technology officer for the entire agency or the chief intelligent or Chief Information officer for the entire CIA and these guys are going look here's a problems here's a we want to do and it's my job to pitch them a system right and I've got I'm paired up with the sales guy and the whole thing is just go how much money can we get out of the government right that's the whole goal and we'll build them what we were pitching was a private cloud system right everybody knows about  out cloud computing now it's like why your Gmail account is available wherever you go it's why Facebook has this massive system of records for everyone everywhere the government wanted to have this these kind of capabilities to Dell ended up getting beat out by Amazon people only you know some people aren't familiar with as many of them are but Amazon runs a secret cloud system for the government I forget what they've rebranded to now but this is just there's this massive  Sharon between industry and government in the classified space that just goes deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper but at this point I was already I had misgivings because of what I'd seen in Japan about government but I was just trying to get by I was trying to ignore the conflicts I was trying to ignore the inconsistencies and I think this is a state that a lot of people in these large institutions not  not just in our country but around the world a struggle with everyday right they got a job they're going to family they got bills they dick they're just trying to get by and they know that some of the things they're doing are not good things they know some of the things they're doing are actively wrong but they know what happens to people who Rock the Boat  eventually  I changed my mind  and when I had gone to Hawaii which was the final position in my career with the intelligence community  I was because of an accident of History here I wasn't supposed to be in this position at all I was supposed to be at a group called The National threat operations center and talk but because of the way Contracting works and again this is covered in the book  I end up being reassigned to this little rinky-dink office that nobody's ever heard of in Hawaii called the office of information sharing and I'm replacing this old-timer who's about to retire really really nice guy but he spent most of his days just reading novels and doing nothing and letting people be content to the fact they're letting people forget that his office existed because he was the only one in it there's there's a man  your who's like over him but it's actually over a larger group and he just looks over him as a sort of a favor so now I come in and now I'm the sole employee of the office of information sharing but I'm not close enough to retirement that I'm okay with just doing nothing at all so I get ambitious and I come up with this idea for a new system called the heartbeat and what the heartbeat is going to do  is connect to basically every information repository in the intelligence Community both at the NSA and across Network boundaries which you normally can't cross but because I've worked at both the CIA and the NSA I knew the network well enough both sides of its sides that normal or Christian this thing would never have seen because you have to be in one or the other I can actually connect these together I could build Bridges across this kind of network space  and then draw all of these records into a new kind of system that was supposed to look at your digital ID basically you're you're sort of ID card that says this is who I am I work for this agency I work in this office these are my assignments these are my group affiliations and because of that the system would be able to eventually aggregate records  they were relevant to your job that were related to you and then it could provide them and basically you could hit this site it would be an update of what we used to call re boards which were manually created there we go look you work in network defense right these are all the things that are happening on network defense you work on on a low economic takeovers and Guatemala you know if this is what's going on for you there  but in my off time I helped the team that sat next to me which was a systems Administration team for Windows networks because I had been Microsoft certified systems engineer' which means basically I knew how to take care of Windows networks and this was all those guys did and they always had way too much work way too much work and I had basically no work that I needed to do at all because all I was supposed to do  share information which was not something that was particularly in demand because most people already knew what they wanted or what they needed so it was basically my job was to sit there and collect a paycheck unless I wanted to get ambitious and so I did some side gigs for these other guys and one of them was running what were called dirty word searches  now dirty word searches are let me let me dial this back because I know we're sort of this is hard to track  everything that the NSA does in large part is classified everything the CIA does in large part is classified if I made lunch plans with other people my office it was classified that was the policy it's dumb they this over classification problem is one of the central flaws in government right now this is the reason we don't understand what they're doing this is why they can get a long way this is why they can get  way with breaking the law or violating our rights for so long you know 5 years 10 years 15 50 years before they see before we see what they were doing and it's because of this routine classification right but every system computer system has a limit on what level of classified information is supposed to be stored on it and we've got all these complicated systems for code words and caveat is that  establish a system of what's called compartment ation and this is the idea when you work at the CIA when you work at the NSA you're not supposed to know what's happening in the office next to you right because you don't have need to know right again that thing from the movies and the reason they have this is they don't want one person to be able to go and know everything Ryan tell everybody everything they don't want anybody to know too much particularly when they're doing lots of bad  things because then there's the risk that you realize they're doing so many bad things that it's past the point that we can justify any might develop sort of an idiot logical objection to that well in the office of information sharing and actually in basically every part of my career before that I had access to everything I had what was called a special caveat on my accesses called pretty back  which means privileged access what this means you're kind of super user you know most people have all of these controls on the kind of information that can access but I'm in charge the system right people who need information they have to get it from somewhere they don't know even the director of the CIA right he says I need to know everything about this well he doesn't know where to get it he's just a manager somebody has to be able to actually cross these thresholds and get those things that guy was me  and so dirty word searches were these kind of automated queries that I would set up to go across the whole network and look at all of the different levels of classification and compartment ation exceptionally controlled information that's kind of you can think of it as Above Top Secret in the special compartments right where you're not even supposed to know what these compartments are for you only know the code word unless you work in them unless you have access to them unless you read into them  one day I got a hit on the dirty word search for a program that I'd never heard of called Stellar Wind it came back because the the little caveat for they're called handling caveats which is like you know you can think of like Burn After Reading or for your eyes only but this one's called STL w-which means Stellar wouldn't unless you know what Stellar Wind is you don't know how to handle it all I knew is it wasn't supposed to be on my system  you know what this is a little bit unusual and it turned out this document was placed on the system because one of the employees who had worked on this program years before had come to Hawaii and this person was a lawyer right I believe and they'd worked in the inspector General's office and they had compiled a report part of the inspector General's report which is when the government is investigating itself into  the operations and activities of this program well this was the domestic Mass surveillance program that I talked about in the very beginning of our conversation that started under the bush White House Stellar Wind was no longer supposed to be really an operation it had been unveiled in a big scandal in December 2005 in the New York Times by journalist James Risin and I I'm not going to name them because I don't want to get wrong  another journalist she can look at the byline now if you want to see their boldness but and there's there's a lot of history here too but now what they had found was of course the bush White House had constructed a warrantless wiretapping program if you remember the warrantless wiretapping Scandal that was affecting everyone in the United States well the bush White House  was really put in a difficult position by the Scandal they would have lost the election over this Scandal because the New York Times actually had this story in October 2004 which was the election year they were there were ready to go with it but at the specific request of the White House talking to the publisher of the New York New York Times salzburger and Bill Keller than the executive editor of the New York Times  the New York Times said we won't run the story because the president just said if you run this story a month before the election that's very tight margin if you recall you'll have blood on your hands and it was so close to 2001 The New York Times just went you know what fine  Americans don't need no the Constitution is being violated they don't need to know  that the Fourth Amendment doesn't mean what they think it means if the government says it's all right and it's a secret you should know about it that's fine now December 2005 why did that change why did the New York Times suddenly run this story well it's because James Rison the reporter who found the story had written a book and he was about to publish this book and the New York Times was about to be in a very uncomfortable position of having to explain why they didn't run this story  and how they got scooped by their own journalist and so they finally did it but it was too late bush had been reelected and now it was sweeping up the broken glass of our lost rights so Congress the bush White House was very effective and as I said before telling a very few select members of Congress that this program existed and they told them this program existed in ways that they wouldn't object to but made them culpable for hiding the existence from the program  the existence of the program from the American people and this is why someone like Nancy Pelosi who you wouldn't exactly think would be buddy-buddy with George Bush was completely okay and defending this kind of program in fact and you know later she said oh well she had objections to the program that she wrote in a letter to the White House but she never showed us the letter she went home well that was that was classified right and this is not to bag on her individually it's just she's a great example in here and not named example everyone knows of how this process  what's the White House will implicate certain very powerful members of Congress in their own criminal activity and so when the when then when the White House gets in trouble for it the Congress has to run cover for the White House and so what happened was Congress passed an emergency law in 2007 called the Protect America act now which should have been our first indication this is a very bad thing because they never named a loss on  thing like that unless something terrible and what it did was it retroactively immunized all of the phone companies in the United States that had been breaking the law millions of times a day by handing your records over to the government which they weren't allowed to do simply on the basis of a letter from the president saying please do this and these companies went look now that we've been uncovered now that we've been  don't read that we're breaking or now that these journalists have shown that we've broken the law and violated the rights of Americans and a staggering scale that could bankrupt our companies because we can be sued for this we will no longer cooperate with you unless you pass a law that says people can't sue us for having done this and so we get the potato Protect America Act which says you know as an emergency this is all public history to yeah you can look this up  on Wikipedia you know and so then  they they go it's an emergency law we have to pass this now we have to keep this program active bush is going to end the warrantless wiretapping program and continue it under this new Authority where it's going to have some special level of oversight in these kind of things eventually but for now we just have to make sure people are safe again they go to fear they say we don't have this program terrorist attacks will continue you know people will die blood on your hands blood on your hands blender hands think of the children  Protect America Act passes the companies get off the hook the bush White House gets off the hook the Congress That Was Then chairing him criminal culpability for authorizing rather letting these things go by without stopping them then passes in 2008 the foreign intelligence surveillance act Amendments of 2008 this is called the FAA fisa amendments Act of 2008  and rather than stopping all of the unlawful and sort of unconstitutional activities that the intelligence agency was doing  they continued it in different ways simply by creating a few legal honk Hoops for them to jump through now this is not to go say you know these things aren't helpful at all it's not say they're not useful at all but it's important to understand when the government's response to any Scandal and this applies to any country is not to make the activities of the person who's caught breaking the law comply with the law  but instead make the activities of the person who is breaking the law legal right they make the law comply with what the agencies want to do rather than make the agencies comply with the law that's a problem and that's what happened here now the intelligence community's Powers actually grew in response to this scandal in 2008 because Congress was on the hook and they just wanted to move on and get this over with there were objections there were people who knew this was  bad idea but it didn't passed on now what the public took away from this because a part of these laws was a requirement that the inspector general of all of these different intelligence Community elements and the Director of National Intelligence submit a report saying this is what happened under that warrantless wiretapping program this is how it complied with the law or how it didn't comply with the law and basically look  back at how this program was constituted what it did what the impacts and effects were and that was supposed to be sort of the Truth and Reconciliation Council right now why am I talking about all this ancient history well I'm sitting here in 2012 with a classified inspector General's report draft report from the NSA that names names that says dignityrestore.com  Cheney this is David Addington this is Nancy Pelosi this is all these people who are involved in the program The Tick-Tock of how it happens it says the director of the NSA that guy who is evacuating the building at the beginning of our our podcast here that guy was asked by the president of the United States if he would continue this program after being told by the White House and the Department of Justice these programs were not lawful that they were not constitutional  you and the president said would you continue this program on my say-so alone knowing that it's risky knowing that it's unlawful and he said yes sir I will if you think that's what's necessary to keep the country safe and at that moment I realized  these guys don't care about the law these guys don't care about the Constitution these guys don't care about the American people they care about the continuity of government they care about the state right and this is something that people have lost we hear this phrase over and over again National Security National Security National Security and we're meant to interpret that to mean Public Safety but National Security is a very different thing for Public Safety National Security is a thing that in previous generations we referred to as state Security National Security  charity was a kind of term that came out of the Bush Administration to run cover for the fact that we were elevating a new kind of secret police across the country  and what does it mean when again in a democracy in the United States the public is not partner to government the public does not hold the leash of government anymore but we are subject to government right now we are subordinate to government  and we're not even allowed to know that it happened now now in the book I tell the fact that I had access to the unclassified version of this report back in Japan and what's interesting is the unclassified version of a report and we've all seen this today with things like the molar report and all of the intelligence reporting has happened in the last several years when the government provides a classified report to the public it's normally the same document the unclassified version of  classified version of the same thing it's just the unclassified version has things blacked out or redacted that they say oh you're not allowed to know this sentence of this paragraph of this page or whatever the document that the public had been given  about the warrantless wiretapping program was a completely different document it was a document tailor-made to deceive and mislead the Congress and the public of the United States and it was effective in doing that and in 2012 what I realized was  this is what real world conspiracies look like right it doesn't have to be smoking Man Behind Closed Doors right it's lawyers and politicians it's ordinary people from the working level to the management level who go if we don't explain this in a certain way we're all going to lose our jobs  or the other way they go we're going to get something out of this if we all work together civilization is the history of conspiracy right what is civilization but a conspiracy for all all of us to do better by working together right but it's this kind of thing  that I think too often we forget because it's boring as hell I want all your listeners right to go to the Washington Post because this document that I discovered that the really changed me has been published courtesy of the Washington Post it's called the inspector General's report on Stellar Wind and you can look at the actual document that I saw that was unredacted right I add no blacked out pages online and what I believe it shows  is that some of the most senior officials in the United States elected and unelected worked together to actively undermine the rights of the American people to give themselves expanded Powers now in their defense they said they were seeking these powers for good and just and Noble costs right they say they were trying to keep us safe  but that's what they always say that's what every government says that's no different than what the Chinese government says or the Russian government says and the question is if they are truly keeping us safe why wouldn't they simply just tell us that why wouldn't they have that debate in Congress why wouldn't they put that to a vote because if they were and they could convince us that they were  they'd win the vote aye and particularly we all know like the Patriot Act passed one of the worst pieces of legislation modern history past  why didn't we get a vote and I think if you read the report the answer we clear so I'm sorry Joe I went on for very long no is amazing it's like don't don't apologize at all it's just completely fascinating that the continuation of this policy came down to one man and the president having this discussion that is so it's much it's much much more much more but right right literally the president at the heart of it yes at the heart of it  every expression of executive power right and by executive we mean the White House here the CIA the NSA the FBI the doj right these guys exist as a part of the executive branch of government in a real way they work for the White House now there are laws and regulations and policies that are supposed to say they're supposed to do this and they're supposed to say they're not supposed to do that but when you look at Federal Regulations when you look at policies as an employee of  Aunt  when you violate these policies the worst thing that happens to you is you lose your job because there's no criminal penalty for the violation of these laws and so it's very easy for people who exist in these structures particularly the very top levels of these structures to go look we have a given set of lawful authorities and these are defined very broadly to give us leeway to do  whatever it is we think is proper and appropriate and just  now take that proper and appropriate and just from the perspective of Any Given individual Ryan any given president now intersect that with what's good for them politically  and that's where problems begin to arise now the safety measure that's supposed to protect us from this in the u.s. system in any democracy broadly is these people are supposed to be what are called public officials that means we know their decisions that means we know their policies that means we know their programs and perogative zand powers like what they are doing both in our name and what they're doing against us and because they  transparent to us we the people can then police their activities we can go and disagree with this we can protest we can't campaign against it right we can try to become the president do whatever they are public officials and we are private citizens they're not supposed to know anything about us right because we in relative terms hold no power and they hold all the power so they have to be under the tightest constraints we need to be  in freest circumstances and yet  the rise of the state Secrets Doctrine right this whole classification system that goes all the way back to last century about the middle of the last century I believe is is when it really started getting tested in court and I think you know more about this in many cases than I do when you start talking about what happened in the FBI and the CIA and the NSA is sort of old dirty work in the the 20th century  is a  they abused their powers repeatedly and continuously they did active harm to domestic politics in the United States the FBI was spying on Martin Luther King and trying to get Martin Luther King to kill himself before the Nobel Prize was going to be awarded in fact after MLK gave his I Have a Dream speech two days later the FBI classified him as the greatest National or I think it was the greatest National Security  the threat in the United States and get this is the FBI this is the the group that everybody's applauding today saying all these wonderful Patriots and heroes now I'm not saying everybody the FBI's bad I'm not saying anybody everybody at the CIA and NSA is bad I'm saying that you don't become Patriot based on where you work patriotism is not about a loyalty to government  patriotism effect is not about loyalty to anything patriotism is a constant effort to do good for the people of your country right it's not about the government it's not about the state and this is a will get into loyalty later because you know I think one of the big criticisms against me that should be talked about Islam they go look this guy is a disloyal he broke an oath he did whatever  loyalty loyalty is a good thing  when it's in the service of something good but it is only good when it's in the service of something good if you're loyal to a bad person if you're loyal to a bad program if you're loyal to a bad government that that loyalty is actively harmful and I think that's overlooked but yeah when you get back into this whole thing about sort of where it came from  why it happened how it could come out of just this small group and then they could slowly kind of Poison by implication by complicity by bringing them into the conspiracy and then having them not say anything about it wider and wider broad body of people and then once you've got enough people in on it it's much easier to convince other people that it's legitimate because they can go look we got 30 people who know about this and none of them have objected to it why are you going to object to  all of this derives from the original sin which is in a democracy creating a system of government  that is in fact a secret government a body of secret law body of secret policy did is far beyond what legitimate government secrets could be this is not say like government has can have no secrecy doll if the government wants to investigate someone without having them respond right we're talking traditional law enforcement sure you know I got to tell this mobster hey you know we're going to start investigating you we the public don't need to know the names of every Terror suspect out in the world right  we do need to know again the powers and programs the policies that our government is asserting at least the broad outlines of it because otherwise how can we control it how do we know if the government is applying its authorities that are supposed to be granted to it by us if we don't know what it is that they're doing and so this is the main thing and really the story behind the title permanent record is look  Joe when you were a kid you know when I was a kid when you were a teenager I like what's the worst thing you ever said you know she did you say anything you weren't proud of did you do anything that you weren't proud of something that today in like the woke is to Twitter land you would get in trouble for I'm sure and that right one of the horrible things about kids growing up today is that they do have all this stuff out there on social media forever and they can be judged  we buy something they did when they were 13  it's exactly that  our worst mistakes our deepest shames we're forgotten right they were lost they were ephemeral even the things we did get caught for they were known for a time maybe they're still remembered by people who are closest to us whether we like them or dislike them but they were people connected to us now we're forced to live in a real way naked before power whether we're talking about Facebook whether we're talking about Google whether we're talking about the  government of any country they know everything about us or much about us rather and we know very little about them and we're not allowed to know more everything that we do now lasts forever not because we want to remember but because we're not allowed to forget just carrying a phone in your pocket is enough for your movements to be demoralized because every cell phone tower that you pass is keeping a record of that  and AT&T keeps those records going back to 2008 under program called hemisphere if you search for Hemisphere and AT&T you'll give story in The Daily Beast about it 18 key keeps your phone records going back to 1983 if any of your listeners were born after 1983 right Born after me or it might be 1987 excuse me 1987 if they're born after 1987 and their AT&T customer over their calls cross 1880s Network 18  he has every phone call they ever made rather the record that it happened not in to sue the contents on the phone call and so I mean they let me turn this around for you Joe because I feel like I've just been given a given a speech when you look at this stuff right when you look at what's happening with government when you look at what's happening with the Trump White House the Obama White House the bush White House you could see this trend happening when you look at what's happening with Facebook when you look at what's happening with Google  and when you look the fact that you go to every restaurant today I just see people looking to phones you know you get on a bus you get on a subway you know you see somebody sitting next to you in traffic you see people looking at phones these devices are connected all the time now people are getting Alexa right now people have OK Google they have you know Siri on their phones they're in their house they've always got these connected microphones where do you think this leads and what is it that gives  you sort of trust in the system faith in the system Li Hao just just so we can start a conversation here what strikes you about this well it's completely alien and its new this is something that's unprecedented we don't have a Long human history of being completely connected via technology this is something we're navigating right now for the first time and it's probably the most powerful thing that the human race has ever seen in terms of  the distribution of information there's nothing that even comes close to it in all of human history and we're figuring it out as we go along and what you exposed is that not only are we figuring out as we go along but that to cover their ass these cell phone companies in cahoots with the government have made it legal for them to gather up all of your phone calls all your text messages all of your emails and store them somewhere so that  Lee if you ever say anything they don't like or do something they don't like they can go back find that and use it against you and we don't know who they are we don't know why they're doing it and we didn't know they could do it until you exposed it the connection of human beings via technology is is both amazing and powerful and incredible in terms of our access to knowledge but terrifying in terms of the government's ability to track our movements track your phone  um calls track everything and under the guise of protecting us from terrorists and protecting us from sleeper cells protecting us from attacks like they really are attacked protecting us from these attacks that's great but there's there's no provision in the Constitution that allows any of this and this is where it gets really squirrelly because they're making up the rules as they go along and they're making up these rules the way you're describing it is step-by-step this has happened to  protect their ass and keep themselves from being implicated and what has been a violation of our rights and our privacy and the Fourth Amendment  yeah I mean I think I think one of the things that  everybody needs to understand when you look at these things and the reason you know we talked about before when I got this information why I didn't just put it on the internet and people criticize me for this they go I didn't share enough information because the journalists are gatekeeping right they've got a big archive and they haven't published everything from it and I told them not to publish everything why did you do this why did you do that  because so again it gets back to legitimate Secrets an illegitimate Secrets some spying from my perspective you know career spy is okay right agreed if you have hacked a terrorists phone right and you're getting some information about that useful agreed yeah if you're spying on a Russian general in charge of a you know rocket division useful right but they're there are lines and degrees in that  it's not useful now the examples that I just gave you these are targeted this is where you're spying on an individual they're known named person that is being monitored for specific reason that is related hopefully from a war people right well even for foreign intelligence in some indications you don't need a warrant strictly although I think they should have morons for all of these investigations because they established a court for precisely this reason called the foreign intelligence  agent surveillance court right now and there's not a judge in the world who wouldn't stamp a warrant saying hey spy on Abu Jihad over here right and if you want to spy on another guy Boris badenov of the rocket division right that that's okay they're going to go with that but then you look at these edge cases and in the archives that are provided to journalists have been stories that have come down where they've  on journalists right they've spied on human rights groups and these kind of things I think people Miss I'm gonna throw up some slides here so forgive me if this gets weird and I put up the wrong ones but since I came forward this foreign intelligence surveillance court that the government says authorized these programs 15 different times was overruled by the first open chords to look at the program these  the federal courts here right that said no actually these programs are unlawful they're likely unconstitutional when you start looking at the facts you see even within the context of the very loose restrictions and laws that apply to the NSA and surveillance they say they broke their own laws you know two thousand seven hundred and seventy six times in a single year and then you ask about that thing that motivates me like why I came forward  we had been trying as a country before I came forward to prove the existence of these programs legally because this is our this is our means of last sort of recourse in our system right we get the executive we got the legislature we got the Judiciary right so congress makes the laws the executive supposed to carry them out the courts are supposed to play referee the executive  had broken the laws Congress was turning a blind eye to the laws and the courts were in this is just months before I came forward going well it does appear that the ACLU and Amnesty International like all of these human rights groups and non-governmental organizations had established that you know these programs are likely unlawful they  likely exist they're simply classified but the government responded with this argument that you just saw saying that well it's a state secret if they do exist you the plaintiffs don't have hard concrete evidence that they do exist and the government is saying legally you have no right to discover evidence from the government right documents demand documents or demand an answer from the government as to whether things these or as to whether or not these things exist because the  just going to give its standard what they call glomar response we can neither confirm nor deny that these things exist which leaves you out in the cold which leaves the courts on the cold the courts go look the government could be breaking the law here look they could be violating the Constitution are but because you can't prove it and because the government does want to play ball and the government says if we were doing this it would be legal and it would be necessary for National Security  whatever the court can't presume to know National Security better than the executive because the courts aren't elected and so this leads to this fundamentally broken system where okay the only way to have the courts review the legality of the programs is to establish the programs exist but the programs are classified so you can't establish the exist unless you have evidence but providing that evidence to courts to journalists to anyone  is a felony right that's punishable by 10 years per count under the Espionage Act and the government has charged every source of public interest journalism who's really made a significant difference in these kind of cases since Daniel Ellsberg really going back to that under the same Espionage Act it's always the same law and this is There's no distinction to government between whether you've sold information to a foreign government for private benefit right or whether you  provide an information only to journalists for the public interest and then that's a fundamentally harmful thing II think when you look at things that have come in the wake of this we're talking about the post 2013 court rulings that found what the government was doing was unlawful you see the courts saying actually that leaks or air quotes leaks can actually be beneficial  show leak is used in the governor's and this you know this is from a federal court these are not exactly my biggest supporters they're recognizing that although leak implies harm it implies something that's broken it's actually helpful it's a leak that's letting in daylight in this context that is the only thing that allows the system to operate in a context where one year before I came forward we had the NSA saying  this kind of stuff didn't happen we had hang on this famous exchange which more than anything made me realize this was a point of no return because I've told you this you've heard this but if you haven't seen it you might not believe me right maybe I'm a sketchy guy whatever one of those Senators I told you that objected to this stuff that was doing the Lassie barks for all those years Ron Wyden was confronting the most senior spy in the United States  General James Clapper who was then the Director of National Intelligence right there's no guy higher than him the buck stops with him when it comes to intelligence he's testifying under oath in front of Congress right now but more broadly in front of the public this televised and Ron Wyden asked him a very specific question about a program mind you that Ron Wyden knows exists because he has security clearance he sits on the intelligence committee and he knows there's domestic Master grants  and this is how it goes this is how the top spy responds under oath  so when I wanted to see is if you could give me a yes or no answer to the question does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans no sir  it does not  not wittingly  there are cases where they could inadvertently perhaps collect but not wittingly  so that was a lie widen it was a lie Clapper knew it was a lie he actually admitted it was a lie after I came forward you know three months later but he said it was the least untruthful thing he could think of to say in the context of being in the hot seat there but what does it mean for a democracy when you can lie under oath to Congress and the congressman even knows you were lying to them but they're afraid to  wrecked you and widen by the way it wasn't a surprise widen gave him those questions 24 hours in advance and he wrote a letter afterwards asking for Clapper to amend his testimony right not not even a press conference but just say this was incorrect whatever so he could go through the legal process and show his fellow congressmen that there was a problem and that they need to do it but all of that was refused to us all of it was denied to us and here I am sitting at the NSA  next to my buddies who I talk to about these programs you know I've gone look at this and they're laughing at it you know I'm laughing at it and it's not it's not that we go oh ha ha ha he's getting away with it it's like what are you going to do these guys are you know they're they're bullshitters that the system is built on lies that even many people many experts who have studied this know our lives but if you can't prove their lies how do you move Beyond  and that's really a question that has never been more relevant than I think it is today under the current White House  so you're in this position will you have this information and you know that these surveillance systems are in place and they're unconstitutional and you feel this deep responsibility to let the American people know about this what what makes you take the leap  so this is covered extensively in the book  because it took a long time I would imagine people people you know yeah right exactly people like to think it's like a cinematic moment where I find this golden document like the seller went report and that's the closest thing to a Smoking Gun right that exists but look if you found that you can read that later look at that and like imagine yourself being like Oh I'm gonna go outside on the courthouse steps and wave this thing burn my life to the ground burn my family to the ground I'm never going to be work again  I'm going to jail for the rest of my life the question is what would it take for you to light a match and burn your life to the ground  for a long time too long the answer was nothing and I'm I'm ashamed of that it took me so long  to get over that hump because I was waiting for somebody else to do it when I saw people like Ron Wyden on this when I saw people like the court case that I showed before where people were actively challenging these programs right journalists had the scent of it and you know there are a lot of people who are going about be in the you know the YouTube comments or whatever go oh I knew this was happening no you did well Bill Bimini you had he will be any bill bill bill excuse me Bill Binney he initially was the one  that came out and spoke about this issue and it's so  yeah Bill Binney is part of shall we say the group of early NSA whistleblowers who came with Thomas Drake Bill Binney Kirk wiebe I believe in Ed Loomis and these guys all got their doors kicked and you know they got harassed by the FBI Tom Drake who was a senior executive at the NSA this guy who had a lot to lose was charged under the same law I was the Espionage Act and these guys who were doing it earlier during the Bush Administration some of them were talking to the journalists  didn't you know maybe it's a ledge don't want to put them on the spot maybe they deny it maybe they don't leave that to them but somebody somewhere was informing this reporting right that got into the New York Times about the bush-era warrantless wiretapping program and eventually journals put this out there people knew these capabilities existed but yeah then there's the person in the YouTube comments was like oh we knew all about this is nothing new and the thing is you can know about some programs and not know about others you can have a  Ian you can know with certainty that this stuff is capable or is possible to capability exists you can know that the government has done this stuff in the past you can know there are likely to do it again you can have all these indications you can have like the jewel versus NSA case that's run by the FF which is about the 18 it's about AT&T setting up secret rooms in their telecommunications facilities where they basically dragged all the fibers for their domestic  internet communications and like phone Communications into a room that's purpose-built for the NSA and then they bring it out but AT&T is nice it's the NSA the NSA denies that these things happen or that are done at all right and so this is the context you say you know and you know let's put it either way maybe you do know right maybe you are an academic researcher maybe your technology logical specialist maybe you're just somebody who  reads all the reporting and you actually know you can't prove it but you know this is going on but that's the thing in a democracy the distance between speculation and fact the distance between what you know and what you can prove to everybody else in the country is everything in our model government because what you know doesn't matter what matters is what we all know and the only way we can all know it is if somebody can prove it if you can prove it and if you don't have the evidence  you can't prove it and of course when we talk about the earlier stuff right like the sort of a more corporate eyes to Media they got a thousand incentives not to get involved in this stuff they need access to the White House they need these officials to sit down with them and give interviews right that's constant content that they need that's access that they need they need to be taken seriously they need to be you know admitted to briefers it is a codependent relationship and yet  rather and so the only way to make sure people understand this broadly is if we all work together right if we collectively can establish a corpus of evidence right a body of facts that is so large and so persuasive it overcomes the natural and understandable resistance of the these more corporatized media groups it  so the political and partisan sort of loyalties that that all of these political factions in the country do where they go you know it's my president even if I don't like this stuff even if I don't agree with this stuff I don't want to say it exists I want to deny it until it's proved you know in HD on video you know signing the order to do this that or the other because otherwise this is chance my guy might not get reelected and that's the only way this kind of stuff can happen and the sad fact is  the opportunities that we have to prove this like the moments in history where we do prove something anything beyond A Reasonable Doubt are so few and so rare that they almost always only come from whistleblowers and I think that's one of the problems that we have particularly in that the climate movement did today look at go ahead I'm sorry did you take any comfort from knowing that  when he was running for office and in his hope and change website he had Provisions to protect whistleblowers and Provisions to to reward people right I mean do you remember all that mean it was eventually redacted or eventually deleted it from the website that's appeared it from yes but that was a big part of his program or what he was running on was that when people were exposing unlawful activity he was going to protect those people  did that you take any comfort in this so campaigned well but Obama also during his campaign said he campaigned actively against the warrantless wiretapping the Bush Administration because remember bushes in the Scandal the height of this on 2007 you know the elections coming up right after and he's going Obama saying you know that's not who we are that's not what we do and yet within a hundred days of him becoming president  now he's sitting in that chair rather than extinguishing these programs he Embraces them and expand why do you think that is Warren trench I think it's actually a again what we talked about earlier first thing every time a new president comes into the White House they get their clearances right they get red into all this stuff during the campaign they get clearance isn't to get written on stuff but when they finally become president right now they're the only people who can sign what these are called the  covert action findings and things like that which are basically you know the intelligence Community wants to assassinate somebody they want to run this illegal program here there or everywhere and they can't do it because their executive agencies without that top level executive sign off and said they got to open the vest right they got to get these guys on side and basically every president since Kennedy they have been successful  and what they call fearing up where as soon as they come in they lead you read you the Litany of Horrible's and they go these are all the threats that we're facing and let's be real it is a dangerous world it's not just all made up BS some of it is right where it's inflated it's not that it's completely false but they make it sound more serious than it actually is but there are real bad people out there who are trying to do real bad things and you have just gone  through a hellish election because our our electoral politics or some disease and now after you've crawled through fire you're already thinking for years ahead you know how how do I stay in this seat and these guys are basically saying if you don't do XY and Z this is going to fall on your lap and the implication which and I don't think they actually say but every president knows is these guys can undermine you  to death if you've got the I see against you right they can Stonewall you they can put out stories that are going to be problematic for you everyday your presidency and it's not that it's necessarily going to cast you out of the White House but it's a problem that is President you very much don't want so in the most charitable interpretation of this you've got a new guy coming in and Obama's case this is a pretty young guy doesn't Focus  focus in this kind of National Security foreign policy stuff throughout his earlier career he's more interested in domestic policy and always has been that's actually one of the positive things to say about Barack Obama he's just trying to make things better at home and now suddenly they go look you need to worry about this country you need to be worried about this group that you've never heard of you need to worry about you know this technology you do all this stuff and the only reason we can tell you this stuff and the only thing dividing  Erica and the abyss are these terrible terrible terrible terrible programs right that are in fact wonderful things because they keep back the darkness  and so here's Here's the the real problem  every present here is that and every president you know first off they've got so many other things to do is they they just kind of nod their head no go I'll deal with this later in my Administration and this is one of the irony's when I come came forward in 2013 right this is now Barack Obama second-term president one of the responses that they had to the mass surveillance Scandal was yes we think they went a little too far this is after the initial thing where they went nobody's listening to your phone calls you know just making data  right nobody nobody can have perfect privacy and also have perfect security so we got a sort of divide a line here between the Constitution and you know what the government wants to do but they said  we were gonna get to it we knew these programs were problematic but if they just gave us more time we would have fixed them maybe it's true right seeking seems awful convenient in hindsight that throughout the entirety of the first term well it seems like what you would say if you got caught right right right right but look in if we're being the most generous that we are here the president is briefed on real and legitimate  and they scare the hell out of them I'm sure and we can we can all imagine being there right those those of us who remember what the world was like post 9/11 fear is a powerful thing but the guys who are doing that briefing  they're no longer scared of it because they've been dealing with this for years this is the oldest thing they'd given this briefing times before the you know when we talk about people talk about the Deep state right they they talk about it like some conspiracy of lizard people it's not that it's something much simpler the Deep state is simply the career government it's the people who are in the same offices who outlive and Outlast presidencies right they've seen Republicans they've seen Democrats They Don't Really Care and they give that same briefing  again and again and they get good at it they know what they want they know what this person saying where's the president they do they don't know who these people are these people have been there before the president they're going to be there after the president and so they give this very effective very fear-inducing speech and then they followed up with their asks which are really demands just politely provided and anyone in that position who is not an expert on this stuff  one who is not ready for this sort of trade-off and who you have to understand as a career politician is entirely use to the horse trading game Ryan going I'll deal with this later or not now or what are the the cost-benefit here and the intelligence Community goes if you give us what we want no one will ever know about it because it's classified it's obviously the easy answer and maybe Barack  honestly did want to get to this later but we can say today is for all the good that may have been done in that white house this is an issue where the president went through two full terms and did not fix the problem but in fact made it worse well it seems like the president has a job that's absolutely impossible and if you come across someone who has been in the position like you know someone who's the head of an Intelligence Agency for a long time and it's very  Savannah has some you know legitimate credentials that show that he's very good at his job and he tells you this is important for National Security we need to keep these things in place it doesn't seem like any one person can run the country and be aware of every single program that every single agency is implemented it seems completely unrealistic and the job itself it just it doesn't seem like any person can do it adequately and when it comes to something like this Mass surveillance state  I could see a president being persuaded by someone who comes to him and says this is why we need to do this  yeah I mean one of the things that I think is the underlying problem and everything that you just described as the president has too much power right and because they have too much power that means they have too much responsibility and I don't think people understand if they haven't lived outside the United States and they haven't sort of traveled or study broadly just how exceptional the American presidency is most countries don't have a single individual  this level of power it's really only the super States and and that may be by Design perhaps that's why they're they're super States but when we look at sort of complex Advanced democracies that are more peaceful they tend to have a more multilateral system that has more people involved in smaller portfolios and a lot of this derives from just the size of the government like you said you know the President is responsible  Isabel for basically everything executive branch and the executive branch is basically every agency that actually doesn't work and so how do you how do you correct for that without breaking it up where you have smaller ministers Ministries and things like that that have different levels of responsibility having a smaller government overall you know back in 1776 the federal government you know it was pretty much a dream we weren't even  interested in having standing armies the idea of an army that existed from year to year was a terrifying forbidding thing and then when you moved to this idea that we have a president that they have these extraordinary powers it's okay because the government's very small the federal government especially is seen as sort of the small and Toothless and weak thing you pause for one second to Spain pause for one second because my ear pods are about to die and I'm going to swap over to another pair these structures are good for a couple hours  hours but we're two hours and 15 minutes here where it will have a little bit of a weird audio issue with the last half of it but Jamie Jamie will take care of it I wanted to talk about you like where you are right now in your life and how you're handling this because you've been in exile for how many years now it's been more than six years six 6 June of 2013 yeah I mean well actually I left May so what is life like  I mean are you in constant hiding I mean what are the issues like  in in the beginning my operational security level as we would call it was was very high I was concerned about being recognized it was concerned about being followed I was concerned really about very bad things happening to me because the government made it very clear that from their position I was the most wanted man in the world they literally brought down the president of Bolivia his aircraft  and would not let it depart as it tried to cross the airspace of Europe not even the United States they wouldn't let it leave until they confirmed I was not on board so yeah that made me a little bit nervous but you can't live like that forever and although I was as careful as I could be I still lived pretty happily because I was an indoor cat to begin with right I've always been a technologist I've always been pretty nerdy so as long  long as I have a screen and internet connection I was pretty happy but in the years past my life has become more and more open you know now I speak openly I live openly I go out our ride the Metro I go to restaurants I know you know for awfully recognize mark  so this is a funny thing is I'm almost never recognized one of those things is I don't give Russian interviews because I don't want my face all over the news which is nice because it just allows people to sort of forget about my face and I can go about my life but I it's one of the weird things that I'm recognized a couple times a year even when I'm not wearing my glasses  in a museum or a grocery store or something like that or out on the street just by somebody who I swear like these people are you might have read a story about him like super recognizers the people just have a great memory for faces yeah because I can be like oh we're in the hood and like a jacket can have a scarf around my face like in the winter and like you can barely see my face and they'll come up to me and they're like are you Snowden  and I'm like whoa what do you say it's pretty impressive I'd say yeah it's nice to meet you and yeah they've it's I've never had a negative interaction from being recognized but for me now because I'm a privacy Advocate like I would I would much rather go on recognized like I don't want to be a celebrity course but the other thing is I'll get recognized in computer stores and I think there's just like a mental Association  people are like in their brain when it's cycling through phases that are recognizes it's going through like the subset of nerdier people or something like that when you're in a computer store because for whatever reason I'm recognized much more frequently when there's some kind of technological like locusts mmm so you're living freely did you had to learn Russian did you learn it yeah I mean my my Russian is still pretty crappy to my great shame  shame because all of my life all of my work is primarily an ink right now you've talked about returning home if you could get a fair trial is is that a feasible thing a fair trial for someone like you is that such a well is that yes and even pocket question I mean look if we're being frank I think all your audience knows the chance of me getting a  Shake in the eastern district of Virginia a couple miles from the headquarters of the CIA is probably pretty slim because that's where they draw the jury pool from right but my objection here is on a larger principle right what happens to me is less important right if I spend the rest of my life in jail that that's less important than what I'm actually requiring the government to agree to which is a single thing right they say face them  using face the music and I'm saying great let's pick the song the thing is  the law that I've been charged under the one that all these whistleblowers have been charged under Thomas Drake Daniel Ellsberg Chelsea Manning Daniel Hale the Drone whistleblower who is in prison right now going through a trial that is precisely similar to what I would be facing his lawyer is asking the court to or telling the court that we want to tell the jury why he did what he did that the government is violating laws the government is violating human rights  it's that these programs are immoral that their unethical this is what motivated this guy to do it and the jury should be able to hear why he did what he did and the jury should be able to decide whether that was right or wrong  and the government has responded you know to this whistleblower argument basically saying we demand the court forbid this guy from breathing the word whistleblower in court he cannot talk about what motivated him he cannot talk about what was revealed why it was revealed what the impacts and effects were he can't talk about whether the public benefited from it where was harmed by it because it doesn't matter now this might surprise a lot of people because to a lot of us we think that's what a jury trial is we think  that's what a fair trial is but the Espionage Act the government uses against whistleblowers meaning broadly here the sources of Journalism is fairly unique in legal system in that it is what's called a strict liability crime a strict liability crime is what the government considers to be basically a crime worse than murder because if you if you murdered somebody like if you just I don't know beat Jamie with the  phone stand right now  you would be able to go to the court and say it was self-defense right like you felt threatened you were in danger for your like even if you weren't right even if you obviously weren't even if you are on tape you could still argue that and the jury could go you full of crap right and they could convict you but if you were in fact acting in self defense if the jury did in fact believe you they could take that into consideration in establishing their verdict right strict liability crimes forbid then the  jury is not allowed to consider why you committed a crime they're only allowed to consider if you committed a crime they're not allowed to consider if the murder was justified there are only allowed to consider if the murder took place and the funny thing in this case is that the murder that we're talking about is telling the truth the Espionage Act in every case is a law the government exclusively uses  against people who told the truth right like that that's what it's about in the context of Journalism they don't bring the Espionage Act against people who lied then they would use fraud or some other statute they say the government is arguing in the context of whistleblowing the telling a telling a important truth to the American people by way of a journalist is a crime worse than murder and I believe and I think most Americans would agree this is fundamentally in  simply wrong and so my whole argument with the United States government since the very beginning was Ben I'll be back for jury trial tomorrow but you have to agree to permit whistleblowers a public interest defense it doesn't matter whether they are whistleblower or not it's just they argued it's the jury the decides whether they are whistleblower or not they have to be able to consider the motivations of why someone did what they did the government says we refuse to allow that because that puts the  the government on trial and we don't trust the jury to consider those questions wow so you have had these conversations then so this has been discussed no this is this is from the Obama Administration that there's been no contact since since the Trump administration because the government basically when they got to this point they went we have no good argument against this and we will never permit this to happen and again I just want to make clear this is not speculation this is not the thing  this is actively happening in the case of Daniel Hale right now I hope you guys can pull up a graphic for because this story just at the papers like two or three weeks ago saying the government is forbidding this guy from from making this argument so your situate your seemingly in a state of limbo then your they're not actively pursuing you it seems that if you're able to move around freely they haven't discovered where you are you're just free to live your life  whew well yeah I mean it's one of these things where you know whether they they know where I am or whether they don't know where I am where I put my head on the pillow doesn't matter so much I'm in Russia right and we should lean into that because I think people they hear Russia particularly in the context of today's news and you see like what people are saying about Tulsi gabbard and things like that any kind of Association anytime your name appears in the same sentence  paragraph seems story is the word Russia it's considered a negative thing now and don't get me wrong I've been a longtime critic of the Russian government I just actually had a major story written about me and our Russian State News Outlet called Ria novosti you guys could probably pull it it's only in Russian though that saying because I spoke favorably about a member of the Russian opposition Alexei navalny  Omni which I wasn't even speaking positively about this guy was saying look I think people have a right to express their opposition in a country and they should be able to do that without fearing retaliation the future because the background here is this this opposition figure has been a longtime thorn in the Russian Administration side and they've just suddenly magically been accused of being  foreign agents or something like that and so everyone connected to this which is like a big Civil Society body had their doors like simultaneously kicked out across the country and they're being investigated for some kind of corruption or something it doesn't even matter and you know I said I posed that just like I was tweeting you know footage of ballot stuffing in the Russian elections just like I've criticized the Russian president by name I've criticized Russian surveillance laws so many  things again and again and again and again and again but yeah so look it does not make my life easier to be trapped in a country that I did not choose people don't remember this I was actually on route to Latin America when the US government canceled my passport which trap me in Russia and for those who are interested again I wrote an entire book that has a lot of detail on this but yeah it's difficult to be  basically engaged in civil opposition to policies of the United States government at the same time as the Russian government and it's a hard thing you know it's not a happy thing but I feel like it's a necessary thing the problem is nobody wants to talk about that nobody wants to engage in that kind of nuance nobody wants to consider those kind of conversations in the current world people believe and this is actually one of the worst things  that Western media does in the context of discussing Russia is they create this Aura of invincibility around the Russian president they go you know this guy's calling all the shots he's pulling all the strings you know this guy is in charge of the world and that's very useful for the Russian government broadly because they can then take that and Replay that on their domestic media and they going to go look how strong we are you know the Americans are afraid of us the Chinese are afraid of as everybody's afraid of us the French were afraid of us we  strong right there's no question that Russia is going to be interfering elections there's no question that America is going to be interfering in Russian elections right nobody nobody likes to talk about this and again I need to substantiate that now that I've said that I've got an old note that I've signed a billion times the New York Times published a story in the wake of you know this contestant 2016 election where they looked into the history of electoral interference  in Russia and the Soviet Union and they found in roughly 50 years 36 different cases of election interference by Russia or the Soviets right this is not a new thing this is something that always happens because that's what intelligence services do that's what they think they're being paid for which is a sad thing but it's a reality because we aren't wise enough to separate covert action from intelligence gathering but in that same study  they found 36 different cases by the Russians and the Soviets they found 81 different cases by the us and this was published by Scott Shane and the New York Times and both the Washington post as well but this is this is the thing like there is a way to criticize the Russian government's policies without criticizing the Russian people who are ordinary people who just want to have a happy life that just want to do better they want the same things that you do  right and every time people go all Russia Russia Russia every time people go Russia bad every time they go Russia's doing this they go Russia is doing that Russian people who have nothing to do with the government feel implicated by that like do you feel like you're in charge of Donald Trump like do you want to be a have Donald Trump's Legacy around your neck and then people go oh well you know you could overthrow Donald Trump you know you could overthrow Putin can you really like is that how it works so yeah I mean  look I have no affiliation I have no love for the Russian government it's not my choice to be here and I've made it very clear I would be happy to return home this is there any concerns applied they would deny you Visa I mean how are you staying there it's a good question so I have a permanent residence people think I'm on her silent but I'm no longer honored it's like a green card now it's going to be renewed every three years so yeah sure it's possible they could kick me out and this was what the story I was telling you about before  former Russian media was they were saying you know the Russian government should take some action against me or shouldn't be welcome here I should go home because why is he criticizing the Russian government right when they're the people is that like the Russian would urge to Fox News way over there I don't know enough about Russian media to tell you I think it's supposed to be more like a Reuters or Associated Press but the hell if I know but the thing is this  what's the alternative right yes the Russian government could screw me but they could screw me even if I didn't say anything and so should I shut up and be quiet in the face of things that I think are in justices because it makes me safer well a lot of pragmatic people will say yeah they say you've done enough they say and you've done your part you know they say whatever right be safe live long be happy but I didn't come forward  be safe if I wanted to be safe I'd still be sitting in Hawaii making a hell of a lot of money to spy on all of you right and nobody ever would have known about this the system would have gotten worse but the system the world the future gets worse every day that we don't do something about every day that we stay silent about all the injustices we see the world gets worse things get worse and yeah it's risky yeah it's uncomfortable but that's why we do it because  if we don't no one else will all those years I was sitting hoping for someone else to come forward and no one did right that's because I was waiting for hero but there are no Heroes right there's only heroic decisions you are never further than one decision away from making a difference doesn't matter whether it's a big difference doesn't matter if it was a small difference because you don't have to save the world by yourself in fact you can't all you have to do is lay down one brick all you have to do is make things a little bit better  in a small way so other people can lay their brick on top of that or beside the end together step by step day by day year by year we build the foundation of something better but yeah it's not going to be safe but it doesn't matter because individually it's not you know me whoever you are that's the Iron Man well I don't care if you're the biggest doomsday prepper with cans full of beans  and if the world ends it's going to affect you we make things better we become safe together right to collectively that is our strength that is the power of civilization that is the power that shapes the future because even if you make life great for you you're going to die someday you're going to be forgotten someday your cans of beans are going to rot someday you can make things safe her you can be more careful right you can be more clever  and there's nothing wrong with that but at the end of the day you have to recognize if you're trying to eliminate all risks from your life what you're actually doing is eliminating all possibility from your life you're trying to collapse the universe of outcomes such that what you've lost is freedom you've lost the ability to act because you were afraid that's a that's what got us into this mess that's a beautiful way to put it are you aware at all of the current state of surveillance  balance and what if anything has changed since your Revelations  yeah I mean the the big thing that's changed since I was in 2013 is now it's mobile-first everything mobile was still a big deal right and the intelligence Community was very much grappling to get its hands around it and to deal with it but now people are much less likely to use laptop than use a desktop than then you should  you know God any kind of wired phone then they already use a smartphone and both Apple and Android devices unfortunately are not especially good in protecting your privacy think right now  you got a smartphone right you might be listening to this on a train somewhere and in traffic right now or you Joe right now you get a phone somewhere in the room right the phone is turned off for at least the screen is turned off it's sitting there it's powered on  and if somebody sends you a message the screen Burrell blinks to life how does that happen but how is it that if someone from any corner of the earth dials a number your phone rings and nobody else's Rings how is it you can dial anybody else's number and only their phone rings right every smartphone every phone at all it's constantly connected to the nearest Cellular Tower every phone even when the screen is off you think it's doing nothing  can't see it because radio frequency emissions are invisible it's screaming in the air saying here I am here I am here is my IMEI I think it's individual manufacturers equipment identity and IMEI individual manufacturers subscriber identity I could be wrong on the break out there but the the acronyms are the IMEI in the imsi and you can search things for these things there to  globally unique identifiers that only exist anywhere in the world in one place right this makes your phone different than all the other phones the IMEI is burned into the hand side of your phone no matter what SIM card you change to it's always going to be the same and it's always going to be telling the phone network it's this physical handset the ime SI is in your sim card right and this is what holds your phone number right is that basically the key the right to use that phone number and so your  phone is sitting there doing nothing you think but it's constantly shouting and saying I'm here who is closest to me that's a cell phone tower and every cell phone tower with its big ears is listening for these little cries for help and go oh right I see Joe Rogan's phone run I see Jamie's phone I see all these phones that are here right now and it Compares notes with the other network towers and  or smartphone Compares notes with them to go who do I hear the loudest and who you hear the loudest is a proxy for proximity for closeness distance right they go whoever I hear more loudly than anybody else that's close to me so you're going to be bound to this cell phone tower and that cell phone towers going to make a note a permanent record saying this phone this phone handset with this phone number at this time was  did to me right and based on your phone handset and your phone number they can get your identity right because you pay for the stuff with your credit card and everything like that and even if you don't write it's still active at your house overnight is still active you know on your nightstand when you're sleeping and still whatever the movements of your phone are the movements of you as a person and those are often quite Lee uniquely identifying it goes to your home it goes to your workplace  other people don't have it sorry and anyway it's constantly shouting this out and then it Compares notes with the other parts of network and when somebody is trying to get to a phone it Compares notes of the network Compares notes to go where is this phone  with this phone number in the world right now and to that cell phone tower that is closest to that phone it sends out a signal saying we have a call for you make your phone's start ringing so your owner can answer it and then it connects it across this whole path but what this means is that whenever you're carrying a phone over the phone is turned on there is a record of your presence at that place that is being made and created by companies it does not need to be kept forever and as fact there's  no good argument for it to be kept forever but these companies see that is valuable information right this is the whole big data problem that we're running into an all this information that used to be ephemeral right where were you when you were 8 years old you know where where'd you go after you had a bad breakup you know who just spend the night with who'd you call after all this information used to be ephemeral meaning it disappeared right like like the morning dew it would be gone no one would remember it but now these things are stored now these  just saved it doesn't matter whether you're doing anything wrong doesn't matter whether you're the most ordinary person on Earth because that's how bulk collection which is the government's euphemism for Mass surveillance Works they simply collected all in advance in hopes that one day it will become useful and that  was just talking about how you connected phone network that's not talking about all those apps on your phone they're contacting the network even more frequently right how do you get a text message notification how do you get an email notification how is it the Facebook knows where you're at you know all of these things these analytics they are trying to keep track through location services on your phone to GPS through even just what wireless access points you're connected to because there's a  Global constantly updated map there's actually many of them of wireless access points in the world because just like we talked about every phone has a unique identifier that's globally unique every wireless access point in the world right you cable modem at home whether it's in your laptop every device that has a radio modem has a globally unique identifier in it and this is standard term you can look it up and these things can be mapped when they're broadcasting in the air because again like  the phone says to the cell phone tower I have this identifier the cell phone tower responds and says I have this identifier and anybody who's listening they can write these things down and all those Google Street View cars that go back and forth right there keeping notes on Whose Wi-Fi is active on this block right and then they build a new giant map so even if you have GPS turned off right as long as you're connected to Wi-Fi those apps can go well I'm connected to jobs  is Wi-Fi but I can also see his neighbor's Wi-Fi here and the other one in this apartment over here and the other one in the apartment here and you should only be able to hear  those for globally unique Wi-Fi access points from these points in physical space right the intersection in between the spreads the domes of all those wireless access points and it's a proxy for location and it just goes on and on and we can talk about this for four more hours we don't have that kind of time it can I ask you this is there a way to mitigate any of this personally I mean is Amy shouting your phone off doesn't even work right  well so it does in a way it's just know I'm the thing was shutting your phone off that is risk is how do you know your phone is actually turned off used to be when I was in Geneva for example working for the CIA we would all carry like drug dealers phones you know the old smartphones the are sorry old dumb phones they're not smart phones and the reason why was just because they had removed all around the back  you could take the battery out right and the one beautiful thing about technology is if there's no electricity in it right if there's there's no go-juice available to it if there's no battery connected to it it's not sending anything because you have to get power from somewhere you have to have power in order to do work but now your phones are all sealed right you can take the batteries out so there are potential ways that you can hack a following word appears to be off but it's not actually off its just  tending to be off whereas in fact it's still listening and doing all this stuff but for the average person that doesn't apply right and I got to tell you guys they've been chasing me all over the place I don't worry about that stuff right and it's because if they are applying that level of effort to me they'll probably get the same information through other routes I am as careful as I can and I you use things like Faraday cages I turn devices off but if they're actually  in the way devices display it's just too great a level of effort even for someone like me to keep that up on a constant basis also if they get me I only trust phones so much so there's only so much they can derive from the compromise and this is how operational security works you think about what are the realistic threats that you're facing that you're trying to mitigate and the mitigation that you're trying to do is what would be the loss will be the Damage Done To You  you if this stuff was exploited much more realistic than worrying about these things that I call Voodoo hex right which are like next-level stuff and actually just a shout out for those of your readers who are interested in this stuff I wrote a paper on this specific problem how do you know when a phone is actually off how do you know when it's actually not spying on you with a brilliant brilliant guy named Andrew bunny Wang he's an MIT PhD and I think electrical engineering  cold the introspection engine that was published in the Journal of open engineering you can find it online and it'll go as deep down in the weeds I promise you as you want we take an iPhone 6 this was back when it was fairly new and we modified it so we could actually not trust the device to report its own state but physically monitor estate to see it was spying on you but for average people ranked this sack of demick that's not your primary  read your primary threats are these bulk collection programs your primary threat is the fact that your phone is constantly squawking to these cell phone towers it's doing all of these things because we leave our phones and state that is constantly on your constantly connected right airplane mode doesn't even turn off Wi-Fi really anymore just turns off the cellular modem but the whole idea is we need identify the problem and the central problem with smartphone  used today is you have no idea what the hell it's doing at any given time like the phone has the screen off you don't know what it's connected to you don't know how frequently is doing it apple and iOS unfortunately makes it impossible to see what kind of network connections are constantly made on the device and to intermediate them going I don't want Facebook to be able to talk right now you know I don't want Google to be able to talk right now I just want my secure messenger app to be able to talk I just want my weather app to be able to talk but I just  my weather and now I'm done with this so I don't want that to be able to talk anymore and we need to be able to make these Intelligent Decisions on not just an app by app basis but a connection by connection basis right you want let's say you use Facebook because you know for whatever judgment we have a lot of people might do it  you want it to be able to connect to Facebook's content servers you want to be able to message a friend you want to be able to download a photograph or whatever but you don't want it to be able to talk to an ad server you don't want it to talk to an analytic server that that's modern your behavior right you don't want to talk to all these third-party things because Facebook crams their garbage and almost every app that you download and you don't even know what's happening because you can't see it right and this is the problem with the data collection used today  is there is an industry that is built on keeping this invisible and what we need to do is we need to make the activities of our devices whether it's a phone whether it's computer whatever more visible and understandable to the average person and then give them control over it so like if you could see your phone right now and in the very center of is a little green icon that's your you know handset or it's a picture of your face whatever and you see all these little spokes coming  off of it that's every app that your phone is talking to right now or every app that is active on your phone right now and all the hosts that it's connecting to and you can see right now wants every three seconds your phone is checking into Facebook and you can just poke that app and then boom it's not talking to Facebook anymore Facebook's not allowed Facebook speaking privileges have been revoked right you would do that we would all do that if there was a button on your phone that said do what I want but not  own me you would press that button right that button is not a does not exist right now and both Google and apple unfortunate apples a lot better at this than Google but neither of them allow that button to exist in fact that actively interfere with it because they say it's a security risk and from a particular perspective they they actually aren't wrong there but it's not enough to go you know we have to lock that capability off from people because we don't trust  they would make the right decisions we think it's too complicated for people to do this we think there's too many connections being made well that is actually a confession of the problem right there if you think people can't understand it if you think there are too many Communications happening if you think there's too much complexity in their it needs to be simplified just like the president can't control everything like that if you have to be the president of the phone and the phone is as complex as the United States government we have a problem guys this should be much more simple  it should be obvious and the fact that it's not and the fact that we read story after Story year after year saying all your data has been breached here this company spying on you hear this company's manipulating your purchases or your search results or they're hiding these things from your timeline or they're influencing you or manipulating an all of these different ways that happens as a result of a single problem and that problem is in  in any quality of available information they can see everything about you they can see everything about what your device is doing and they can do whatever they want with your device you on the other hand owns the device well rather you paid for the device but increasingly these corporations Own It increasingly these government's own it and increasingly we are living in a world where we do all the work right we pay all the taxes we pay all the costs but we own less  and less and nobody understands this better than the youngest generation well it seems like our data became a commodity before we understood what it was it became this thing that's insanely valuable to Google and Facebook and all these social media platforms before we understood what we were giving up they were making billions of dollars and then once that money is being earned and once everyone is accustomed to the situation it's very difficult to pull the reins back it's very difficult to turn that horse around  it precisely because the money then becomes power right right the information then becomes influence that also seems to be the same sort of situation that would happen with these Mass surveillance dates once they have the access it's going to be incredibly difficult for them to relinquish that  yeah no you're exactly correct and this is the the subject of the book I mean this this is the permanent record in this is where it came from this is how it came to exist the story of our lifetimes is how intentionally by design a number of Institutions both governmental and corporate realized it was in their mutual interest to conceal their data collection activities to increase  the breadth and depth of their sensor networks that were sort of spread out through Society remember back in the day intelligence collection in the United States even in sigyn used to mean sending an FBI agent right to put alligator clips on an embassy building or sending in a somebody disguised as a Workman and they put a bug in a building or they built a satellite listening site right we call these foreign set were foreign satellite collection  well the desert somewhere they built a big parabolic collector and it's just listening to satellite emissions right but these satellite emissions the satellite links were owned by militaries they were exclusive to government's right it wasn't affecting everybody broadly all surveillance was targeted because it had to be what changed with technology is that surveillance could now become indiscriminate it could become Dragnet it  come bulk collection which should become one of the dirtiest phrases and language if we have any kind of decency but we were intentionally this was intentionally concealed from us right the government did it they use classification companies did it they intentionally didn't talk about it they denied these things were going they said you agreed to this and you didn't agree to nothing like this I'm sorry right they go we put that term  terms of service page up and you click that you clicked a button that said I agree because you were trying to open an account so you could talk to your friends you were trying to get driving directions you were trying to get an email account you weren't trying to agree to some 600-page legal form they even if you read you wouldn't understand and it doesn't matter even if you did understand because one of the very first paragraphs and it said this agreement can be changed at any time unilaterally without your consent by the company right they  built a legal Paradigm that presumes records collected about us do not belong to us this is sort of one of the core principles on which Mass surveillance from the government's perspective in the United States is legal and you have to understand that all the stuff we talked about today the government says everything we do is legal right and they go so it's fine our perspective is a public should be well that's actually the problem because this is an okay the Scandal  isn't how they're breaking the law the scandals that they don't have to break the law and the way they say they're not breaking the law is something called the third party Doctrine third party Doctrine is a  legal principle and derived from a case and I believe the 1970s called Smith versus Maryland and Smith was this knucklehead who was harassing this lady making phone calls to our house and when she would pick up he just I don't know sit there heavy breathing whatever like a classic creeper and you know it was terrifying this poor lady so she calls the cops and says one day I got one of these phone calls and then I see this car  are creeping past my house on the street and she got a license plate number so she goes to the cops and she goes is this the guy and the cops again they're trying to do a good thing here they look up his license plate number and they find out where this guy is and then they go what phone number is registered to that house and they go to the phone company and they say can you give us this record the phone company says yeah sure and it's the guy the cops got there man right so they go arrest this  guy and then in court his lawyer brings all this stuff up and they go  you did this without a warrant that sorry that was that was the the problem was they went to the phone company and they got the records without a warrant they just asked for to they subpoenaed it right some lower standard of legal review and the company gave it to him and got the guy they marchmont jail and they could have gotten a warrant right but it was just expedience they just didn't want to take the time the small town cops you can understand how it happens they know the guy's a creeper they just want to get him off to jail and so they made a mistake with  Kevin doesn't want to let go they fight on this and they go  it wasn't actually they weren't his records and so because they didn't belong to him he didn't have a Fourth Amendment right to demand a warrant be issued for them they were the company's records and the company provided them voluntarily and hence no warrant was required because you can give whatever you want without a warrant as long as it's yours now here's the problem the government extrapolated a principle in a single case of a single known suspected  Criminal Who had they had real good reasons to spec suspect was their guy  and use that to go to a company and get records from them and establish a precedent these records don't belong to the guy they belong to the company and then they said well if one person doesn't have a fourth amendment interest in records held by a company no one does and so the company then has absolute proprietary ownership of all of these records about all of our lives and remember this is back in the 1970s you know the internet hardly exists in these kind of context smartphones you know don't exist  modern society modern Communications don't exist this is the very beginning of the technological era and Flash Forward now 40 years  and they are still relying on this precedent about this one you know perfect creeper to go nobody has a privacy right for anything that's held by a company and so long as they do that companies are going to be extraordinarily powerful and they're going to be extraordinary abusive and this is something that people don't get they go oh well it's data collection right they're exploiting data this is data about human lives it is State about people these records are about you it's not data that's being  exploited its people that are being exploited it's not data that's being manipulated it's you that's being mm manipulated and this this is this is something that I think a lot of people are beginning to understand the problem is the companies and the government are still pretending they don't understand or disagreeing with this and this is reminds me of something that one of my old friends John Perry Barlow who served with  with me at the freedom of the press foundation on the president of the board used to say to me  which is you can't awaken someone who's pretending to be asleep he said it's an old Native American saying that's a great expression it's a good way to yeah I think that's a good way to end this Ed thank you very much for doing this I really appreciate it please tell everybody the title of your book and it's available right now  sure yes it is it's on shelves everywhere at least until the government find some other way to ban it it is called a permanent record and I hope you'll read it I will read it and I think what you've done is incredibly Brave and I think you're a very important part of History I think when all is said and done what you did and what you exposed is going to change the way we view Mass surveillance change the way we view government oversight and  the way we view the distribution of information I really think it's very very important and it was an honor to talk to you man thank you it was my pleasure thank you so much for having take care of
